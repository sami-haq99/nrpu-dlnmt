[CLS] world live looked [SEP] that is to say, there were some choices, but not everything was a matter of choice. [SEP] world live [SEP]
[CLS] choices choice matter [SEP] and the world we now live in looks like this. [SEP] question good bad [SEP]
[CLS] world live [SEP] and the question is, is this good news, or bad news? [SEP] answer [SEP]
[CLS] question good bad [SEP] and the answer is yes. [SEP] good talk bad [SEP]
[CLS] answer [SEP] we all know what's good about it, so i'm going to talk about what's bad about it. [SEP] people effects choice negative [SEP]
[CLS] good talk bad [SEP] all of this choice has two effects, two negative effects on people. [SEP] paradoxically effect paralysis liberation produces [SEP]
[CLS] people effects choice negative [SEP] one effect, paradoxically, is that it produces paralysis, rather than liberation. [SEP] choose people options find difficult [SEP]
[CLS] paradoxically effect paralysis liberation produces [SEP] with so many options to choose from, people find it very difficult to choose at all. [SEP] plans give dramatic study investments voluntary retirement [SEP]
[CLS] choose people options find difficult [SEP] i'll give you one very dramatic example of this: a study that was done of investments in voluntary retirement plans. [SEP] vanguard workplaces colleague mine access investment records gigantic mutual fund [SEP]
[CLS] plans give dramatic study investments voluntary retirement [SEP] a colleague of mine got access to investment records from vanguard, the gigantic mutual fund company of about a million employees and about 2,000 different workplaces. [SEP] mutual offered rate percent found funds employer participation [SEP]
[CLS] vanguard workplaces colleague mine access investment records gigantic mutual fund [SEP] and what she found is that for every 10 mutual funds the employer offered, rate of participation went down two percent. [SEP] funds percent offer fewer employees participate [SEP]
[CLS] mutual offered rate percent found funds employer participation [SEP] you offer 50 funds -- 10 percent fewer employees participate than if you only offer five. why? [SEP] choose tomorrow damn hard decide put funds fund [SEP]
[CLS] funds percent offer fewer employees participate [SEP] because with 50 funds to choose from, it's so damn hard to decide which fund to choose that you'll just put it off until tomorrow. [SEP] tomorrow [SEP]
[CLS] choose tomorrow damn hard decide put funds fund [SEP] and then tomorrow, and then tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow, and of course tomorrow never comes. [SEP] money understand employer people eat dog food retire put making [SEP]
[CLS] tomorrow [SEP] understand that not only does this mean that people are going to have to eat dog food when they retire because they don't have enough money put away, it also means that making the decision is so hard that they pass up significant matching money from the employer. [SEP] participating dollars employer contribution passing year happily match [SEP]
[CLS] money understand employer people eat dog food retire put making [SEP] by not participating, they are passing up as much as 5,000 dollars a year from the employer, who would happily match their contribution. [SEP] choices paralysis consequence [SEP]
[CLS] participating dollars employer contribution passing year happily match [SEP] so paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices. [SEP] makes world [SEP]
[CLS] choices paralysis consequence [SEP] and i think it makes the world look like this. [SEP] eternity decision [SEP]
[CLS] makes world [SEP] you really want to get the decision right if it's for all eternity, right? [SEP] wrong fund dressing pick mutual salad [SEP]
[CLS] eternity decision [SEP] you don't want to pick the wrong mutual fund, or even the wrong salad dressing. [SEP] effect choice manage overcome paralysis make end satisfied result fewer [SEP]
[CLS] wrong fund dressing pick mutual salad [SEP] so that's one effect. the second effect is that even if we manage to overcome the paralysis and make a choice, we end up less satisfied with the result of the choice than we would be if we had fewer options to choose from. [SEP] reasons [SEP]
[CLS] effect choice manage overcome paralysis make end satisfied result fewer [SEP] and there are several reasons for this. [SEP] salad decision made perfect dressings dressing lot choose buy regret [SEP]
[CLS] reasons [SEP] one of them is that with a lot of different salad dressings to choose from, if you buy one, and it's not perfect -- and, you know, what salad dressing is? -- it's easy to imagine that you could have made a different choice that would have been better. and what happens is this imagined alternative induces you to regret the decision you made, and this regret subtracts from the satisfaction you get out of the decision you made, even if it was a good decision. [SEP] chose easier regret disappointing options option [SEP]
[CLS] salad decision made perfect dressings dressing lot choose buy regret [SEP] the more options there are, the easier it is to regret anything at all that is disappointing about the option that you chose. [SEP] call opportunity costs economists [SEP]
[CLS] chose easier regret disappointing options option [SEP] second, what economists call "opportunity costs." [SEP] dan gilbert made big point morning talking things depends compare [SEP]
[CLS] call opportunity costs economists [SEP] dan gilbert made a big point this morning of talking about how much the way in which we value things depends on what we compare them to. [SEP] alternatives reject chosen lots easy imagine attractive features make satisfied [SEP]
[CLS] dan gilbert made big point morning talking things depends compare [SEP] well, when there are lots of alternatives to consider, it is easy to imagine the attractive features of alternatives that you reject, that make you less satisfied with the alternative that you've chosen. [SEP] yorkers apologize [SEP]
[CLS] alternatives reject chosen lots easy imagine attractive features make satisfied [SEP] here's an example. for those of you who aren't new yorkers, i apologize. [SEP] thinking supposed [SEP]
[CLS] yorkers apologize [SEP] but here's what you're supposed to be thinking. [SEP] hamptons couple [SEP]
[CLS] thinking supposed [SEP] here's this couple on the hamptons. [SEP] estate expensive real [SEP]
[CLS] hamptons couple [SEP] very expensive real estate. [SEP] gorgeous beach beautiful day [SEP]
[CLS] estate expensive real [SEP] gorgeous beach. beautiful day. they have it all to themselves. [SEP] damn thinking august guy [SEP]
[CLS] gorgeous beach beautiful day [SEP] what could be better? "well, damn it," this guy is thinking, "it's august. [SEP] manhattan neighborhood [SEP]
[CLS] damn thinking august guy [SEP] everybody in my manhattan neighborhood is away. [SEP] building parking front [SEP]
[CLS] manhattan neighborhood [SEP] i could be parking right in front of my building. " [SEP] opportunity space day spends weeks nagged idea missing great parking [SEP]
[CLS] building parking front [SEP] and he spends two weeks nagged by the idea that he is missing the opportunity, day after day, to have a great parking space. [SEP] choose opportunity terrific costs subtract satisfaction [SEP]
[CLS] opportunity space day spends weeks nagged idea missing great parking [SEP] opportunity costs subtract from the satisfaction we get out of what we choose, even when what we choose is terrific. [SEP] costs options attractive features reflected opportunity [SEP]
[CLS] choose opportunity terrific costs subtract satisfaction [SEP] and the more options there are to consider, the more attractive features of these options are going to be reflected by us as opportunity costs. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] costs options attractive features reflected opportunity [SEP] here's another example. [SEP] points cartoon makes lot [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] now this cartoon makes a lot of points. [SEP] slowly makes points living moment things [SEP]
[CLS] points cartoon makes lot [SEP] it makes points about living in the moment as well, and probably about doing things slowly. [SEP] choosing thing things point makes [SEP]
[CLS] slowly makes points living moment things [SEP] but one point it makes is that whenever you're choosing one thing, you're choosing not to do other things. [SEP] features attractive things lots make [SEP]
[CLS] choosing thing things point makes [SEP] and those other things may have lots of attractive features, and it's going to make what you're doing less attractive. [SEP] escalation expectations [SEP]
[CLS] features attractive things lots make [SEP] third: escalation of expectations. [SEP] jeans hit replace [SEP]
[CLS] escalation expectations [SEP] this hit me when i went to replace my jeans. [SEP] time wear jeans [SEP]
[CLS] jeans hit replace [SEP] i wear jeans almost all the time. [SEP] flavor crap uncomfortable jeans bought fit incredibly wore long washed [SEP]
[CLS] time wear jeans [SEP] and there was a time when jeans came in one flavor, and you bought them, and they fit like crap, and they were incredibly uncomfortable, and if you wore them long enough and washed them enough times, they started to feel ok. [SEP] jeans years replace wearing pair size [SEP]
[CLS] flavor crap uncomfortable jeans bought fit incredibly wore long washed [SEP] so i went to replace my jeans after years and years of wearing these old ones, and i said, you know, "i want a pair of jeans. here's my size." [SEP] fit easy relaxed shopkeeper slim [SEP]
[CLS] jeans years replace wearing pair size [SEP] and the shopkeeper said, "do you want slim fit, easy fit, relaxed fit? [SEP] fly button zipper acid-washed stonewashed [SEP]
[CLS] fit easy relaxed shopkeeper slim [SEP] you want button fly or zipper fly? you want stonewashed or acid-washed? [SEP] distressed [SEP]
[CLS] fly button zipper acid-washed stonewashed [SEP] do you want them distressed? [SEP] blah cut tapered boot [SEP]
[CLS] distressed [SEP] you want boot cut, you want tapered, blah blah blah... "on and on he went. [SEP] kind dropped recovered jaw [SEP]
[CLS] blah cut tapered boot [SEP] my jaw dropped, and after i recovered, i said, "i want the kind that used to be the only kind." [SEP] truth store jeans idea spent hour damn walked best-fitting [SEP]
[CLS] kind dropped recovered jaw [SEP] he had no idea what that was, so i spent an hour trying on all these damn jeans, and i walked out of the store -- truth! -- with the best-fitting jeans i had ever had. [SEP] choice made [SEP]
[CLS] truth store jeans idea spent hour damn walked best-fitting [SEP] i did better. all this choice made it possible for me to do better. [SEP] worse felt [SEP]
[CLS] choice made [SEP] but i felt worse. [SEP] wrote book explain [SEP]
[CLS] worse felt [SEP] why? i wrote a whole book to try to explain this to myself. [SEP] reason felt worse options expectations good pair jeans [SEP]
[CLS] wrote book explain [SEP] the reason i felt worse is that, with all of these options available, my expectations about how good a pair of jeans should be went up. [SEP] low flavor expectations [SEP]
[CLS] reason felt worse options expectations good pair jeans [SEP] i had very low -- i had no particular expectations when they only came in one flavor. [SEP] flavors damn perfect [SEP]
[CLS] low flavor expectations [SEP] when they came in 100 flavors, damn it, one of them should've been perfect. [SEP] good perfect [SEP]
[CLS] flavors damn perfect [SEP] and what i got was good, but it wasn't perfect. [SEP] expected compared disappointing comparison [SEP]
[CLS] good perfect [SEP] and so i compared what i got to what i expected, and what i got was disappointing in comparison to what i expected. [SEP] adding options people lives increase expectations good [SEP]
[CLS] expected compared disappointing comparison [SEP] adding options to people's lives can't help but increase the expectations people have about how good those options will be. [SEP] results produce satisfaction good [SEP]
[CLS] adding options people lives increase expectations good [SEP] and what that's going to produce is less satisfaction with results, even when they're good results. [SEP] world marketing [SEP]
[CLS] results produce satisfaction good [SEP] nobody in the world of marketing knows this, because if they did, you wouldn't all know what this was about. [SEP] truth [SEP]
[CLS] world marketing [SEP] the truth is more like this. [SEP] worse surprise reason back people experiences pleasant [SEP]
[CLS] truth [SEP] the reason that everything was better back when everything was worse is that when everything was worse, it was actually possible for people to have experiences that were a pleasant surprise. [SEP] nowadays affluent industrialized citizens expectation world live perfection hope stuff [SEP]
[CLS] worse surprise reason back people experiences pleasant [SEP] nowadays, the world we live in -- we affluent, industrialized citizens, with perfection the expectation -- the best you can ever hope for is that stuff is as good as you expect it to be. [SEP] expectations roof pleasantly surprised [SEP]
[CLS] nowadays affluent industrialized citizens expectation world live perfection hope stuff [SEP] you will never be pleasantly surprised because your expectations, my expectations, have gone through the roof. [SEP] secret happiness expectations low [SEP]
[CLS] expectations roof pleasantly surprised [SEP] the secret to happiness -- this is what you all came for -- the secret to happiness is low expectations. [SEP] moment wife wonderful autobiographical married [SEP]
[CLS] secret happiness expectations low [SEP] i want to say -- just a little autobiographical moment -- that i actually am married to a wife, and she's really quite wonderful. [SEP] settle [SEP]
[CLS] moment wife wonderful autobiographical married [SEP] i couldn't have done better. i didn't settle. [SEP] thing settling bad [SEP]
[CLS] settle [SEP] but settling isn't always such a bad thing. [SEP] responsible finally dissatisfied clear consequence buying bad-fitting pair jeans kind [SEP]
[CLS] thing settling bad [SEP] finally, one consequence of buying a bad-fitting pair of jeans when there is only one kind to buy is that when you are dissatisfied, and you ask why, who's responsible, the answer is clear: the world is responsible. what could you do? [SEP] disappointing responsible hundreds styles jeans buy [SEP]
[CLS] responsible finally dissatisfied clear consequence buying bad-fitting pair jeans kind [SEP] when there are hundreds of different styles of jeans available, and you buy one that is disappointing, and you ask why, who's responsible? [SEP] equally clear answer question [SEP]
[CLS] disappointing responsible hundreds styles jeans buy [SEP] it is equally clear that the answer to the question is you. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] equally clear answer question [SEP] you could have done better. [SEP] display failure hundred kinds jeans excuse [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] with a hundred different kinds of jeans on display, there is no excuse for failure. [SEP] good decisions people make results feel disappointed blame [SEP]
[CLS] display failure hundred kinds jeans excuse [SEP] and so when people make decisions, and even though the results of the decisions are good, they feel disappointed about them; they blame themselves. [SEP] clinical generation depression exploded industrial world [SEP]
[CLS] good decisions people make results feel disappointed blame [SEP] clinical depression has exploded in the industrial world in the last generation. [SEP] significant experiences contributor depression suicide high fault explosion people disappointing [SEP]
[CLS] clinical generation depression exploded industrial world [SEP] i believe a significant -- not the only, but a significant -- contributor to this explosion of depression, and also suicide, is that people have experiences that are disappointing because their standards are so high, and then when they have to explain these experiences to themselves, they think they're at fault. [SEP] objectively general worse net result feel [SEP]
[CLS] significant experiences contributor depression suicide high fault explosion people disappointing [SEP] and so the net result is that we do better in general, objectively, and we feel worse. [SEP] remind [SEP]
[CLS] objectively general worse net result feel [SEP] so let me remind you. [SEP] true dogma false official [SEP]
[CLS] remind [SEP] this is the official dogma, the one that we all take to be true, and it's all false. it is not true. [SEP] choice question follow [SEP]
[CLS] true dogma false official [SEP] there's no question that some choice is better than none, but it doesn't follow from that that more choice is better than some choice. [SEP] amount magical [SEP]
[CLS] choice question follow [SEP] there's some magical amount. i don't know what it is. [SEP] welfare pretty confident long passed point options improve [SEP]
[CLS] amount magical [SEP] i'm pretty confident that we have long since passed the point where options improve our welfare. [SEP] matter policy affluence thing enables choice industrial societies material [SEP]
[CLS] welfare pretty confident long passed point options improve [SEP] now, as a policy matter -- i'm almost done -- as a policy matter, the thing to think about is this: what enables all of this choice in industrial societies is material affluence. [SEP] world choice lots places heard problem [SEP]
[CLS] matter policy affluence thing enables choice industrial societies material [SEP] there are lots of places in the world, and we have heard about several of them, where their problem is not that they have too much choice. [SEP] problem [SEP]
[CLS] world choice lots places heard problem [SEP] their problem is that they have too little. [SEP] affluent modern western societies stuff talking peculiar problem [SEP]
[CLS] problem [SEP] so the stuff i'm talking about is the peculiar problem of modern, affluent, western societies. [SEP] steve child frustrating infuriating levitt talked yesterday expensive seats money [SEP]
[CLS] affluent modern western societies stuff talking peculiar problem [SEP] and what is so frustrating and infuriating is this: steve levitt talked to you yesterday about how these expensive and difficult-to-install child seats don't help. it's a waste of money. [SEP] expensive complicated choices telling simply [SEP]
[CLS] steve child frustrating infuriating levitt talked yesterday expensive seats money [SEP] what i'm telling you is that these expensive, complicated choices -- it's not simply that they don't help. [SEP] hurt [SEP]
[CLS] expensive complicated choices telling simply [SEP] they actually hurt. [SEP] make worse [SEP]
[CLS] hurt [SEP] they actually make us worse off. [SEP] improved people options societies make enables choices shifted lives [SEP]
[CLS] make worse [SEP] if some of what enables people in our societies to make all of the choices we make were shifted to societies in which people have too few options, not only would those people's lives be improved, but ours would be improved also. [SEP] pareto-improving move economists call [SEP]
[CLS] improved people options societies make enables choices shifted lives [SEP] this is what economists call a "pareto-improving move." [SEP] income people redistribution make poor excess choice plagues [SEP]
[CLS] pareto-improving move economists call [SEP] income redistribution will make everyone better off -- not just poor people -- because of how all this excess choice plagues us. [SEP] conclude cartoon person supposed read sophisticated fish [SEP]
[CLS] income people redistribution make poor excess choice plagues [SEP] so to conclude. you're supposed to read this cartoon, and, being a sophisticated person, say, "ah! what does this fish know? [SEP] fishbowl [SEP]
[CLS] conclude cartoon person supposed read sophisticated fish [SEP] you know, nothing is possible in this fishbowl. " [SEP] impoverished imagination world myopic view read [SEP]
[CLS] fishbowl [SEP] impoverished imagination, a myopic view of the world -- and that's the way i read it at first. [SEP] thought view fish [SEP]
[CLS] impoverished imagination world myopic view read [SEP] the more i thought about it, however, the more i came to the view that this fish knows something. [SEP] freedom truth matter shatter fishbowl paralysis [SEP]
[CLS] thought view fish [SEP] because the truth of the matter is that if you shatter the fishbowl so that everything is possible, you don't have freedom. you have paralysis. [SEP] satisfaction shatter fishbowl decrease [SEP]
[CLS] freedom truth matter shatter fishbowl paralysis [SEP] if you shatter this fishbowl so that everything is possible, you decrease satisfaction. [SEP] paralysis satisfaction increase decrease [SEP]
[CLS] satisfaction shatter fishbowl decrease [SEP] you increase paralysis, and you decrease satisfaction. [SEP] fishbowl [SEP]
[CLS] paralysis satisfaction increase decrease [SEP] everybody needs a fishbowl. [SEP] limited fish [SEP]
[CLS] fishbowl [SEP] this one is almost certainly too limited -- perhaps even for the fish, certainly for us. [SEP] disaster misery suspect absence metaphorical fishbowl recipe [SEP]
[CLS] limited fish [SEP] but the absence of some metaphorical fishbowl is a recipe for misery, and, i suspect, disaster. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] disaster misery suspect absence metaphorical fishbowl recipe [SEP] thank you very much. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] you know, i've talked about some of these projects before -- about the human genome and what that might mean, and discovering new sets of genes. [SEP] biology point life starting digitizing digital code phase designing synthesizing [SEP]
[CLS] genes talked projects human genome discovering sets [SEP] we're actually starting at a new point: we've been digitizing biology, and now we're trying to go from that digital code into a new phase of biology with designing and synthesizing life. [SEP] questions big [SEP]
[CLS] biology point life starting digitizing digital code phase designing synthesizing [SEP] so, we've always been trying to ask big questions. [SEP] life levels biologists understand [SEP]
[CLS] questions big [SEP] "what is life?" is something that i think many biologists have been trying to understand at various levels. [SEP] approaches paring components minimal [SEP]
[CLS] life levels biologists understand [SEP] we've tried various approaches, paring it down to minimal components. [SEP] years world genome computer digitizing sequenced human analog biology digital [SEP]
[CLS] approaches paring components minimal [SEP] we've been digitizing it now for almost 20 years; when we sequenced the human genome, it was going from the analog world of biology into the digital world of the computer. [SEP] life universe regenerate create digital [SEP]
[CLS] years world genome computer digitizing sequenced human analog biology digital [SEP] now we're trying to ask, "can we regenerate life or can we create new life out of this digital universe?" [SEP] genome organism mycoplasma genitalium laboratory map small smallest species self-replicate [SEP]
[CLS] life universe regenerate create digital [SEP] this is the map of a small organism, mycoplasma genitalium, that has the smallest genome for a species that can self-replicate in the laboratory, and we've been trying to just see if we can come up with an even smaller genome. [SEP] genes knock order [SEP]
[CLS] genome organism mycoplasma genitalium laboratory map small smallest species self-replicate [SEP] we're able to knock out on the order of 100 genes out of the 500 or so that are here. [SEP] simple map trust time cell metabolic compared genes knock yield [SEP]
[CLS] genes knock order [SEP] when we look at its metabolic map, it's relatively simple compared to ours -- trust me, this is simple -- but when we look at all the genes that we can knock out one at a time, it's very unlikely that this would yield a living cell. [SEP] questions decided forward synthesize chromosome vary components fundamental [SEP]
[CLS] simple map trust time cell metabolic compared genes knock yield [SEP] so we decided the only way forward was to actually synthesize this chromosome so we could vary the components to ask some of these most fundamental questions. [SEP] chromosome started road synthesize [SEP]
[CLS] questions decided forward synthesize chromosome vary components fundamental [SEP] and so we started down the road of: can we synthesize a chromosome? [SEP] chemistry permit making large molecules [SEP]
[CLS] chromosome started road synthesize [SEP] can chemistry permit making these really large molecules where we've never been before? [SEP] chromosome boot [SEP]
[CLS] chemistry permit making large molecules [SEP] and if we do, can we boot up a chromosome? [SEP] chromosome material piece inert chemical [SEP]
[CLS] chromosome boot [SEP] a chromosome, by the way, is just a piece of inert chemical material. [SEP] pace digitizing life increasing exponential [SEP]
[CLS] chromosome material piece inert chemical [SEP] so, our pace of digitizing life has been increasing at an exponential pace. [SEP] increasing curve ability write genetic code moving pretty slowly latest [SEP]
[CLS] pace digitizing life increasing exponential [SEP] our ability to write the genetic code has been moving pretty slowly but has been increasing, and our latest point would put it on, now, an exponential curve. [SEP] years ago started [SEP]
[CLS] increasing curve ability write genetic code moving pretty slowly latest [SEP] we started this over 15 years ago. [SEP] stages fact starting experiments bioethical review [SEP]
[CLS] years ago started [SEP] it took several stages, in fact, starting with a bioethical review before we did the first experiments. [SEP] difficult turns synthesizing dna [SEP]
[CLS] stages fact starting experiments bioethical review [SEP] but it turns out synthesizing dna is very difficult. [SEP] make dna letters length process tens thousands machines world small [SEP]
[CLS] difficult turns synthesizing dna [SEP] there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that make small pieces of dna -- 30 to 50 letters in length -- and it's a degenerate process, so the longer you make the piece, the more errors there are. [SEP] errors create method putting pieces correct [SEP]
[CLS] make dna letters length process tens thousands machines world small [SEP] so we had to create a new method for putting these little pieces together and correct all the errors. [SEP] attempt starting phi digital information genome [SEP]
[CLS] errors create method putting pieces correct [SEP] and this was our first attempt, starting with the digital information of the genome of phi x174. [SEP] bacteria small virus kills [SEP]
[CLS] attempt starting phi digital information genome [SEP] it's a small virus that kills bacteria. [SEP] letters pieces designed error correction dna molecule [SEP]
[CLS] bacteria small virus kills [SEP] we designed the pieces, went through our error correction and had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters. [SEP] bacteria code made particles exciting phase piece inert chemical put [SEP]
[CLS] letters pieces designed error correction dna molecule [SEP] the exciting phase came when we took this piece of inert chemical and put it in the bacteria, and the bacteria started to read this genetic code, made the viral particles. [SEP] coli viral particles released cells back killed [SEP]
[CLS] bacteria code made particles exciting phase piece inert chemical put [SEP] the viral particles then were released from the cells and came back and killed the e. coli. [SEP] model talking oil industry recently understood [SEP]
[CLS] coli viral particles released cells back killed [SEP] i was talking to the oil industry recently and i said they clearly understood that model. [SEP] laughed guys [SEP]
[CLS] model talking oil industry recently understood [SEP] they laughed more than you guys are. [SEP] system situation software build hardware biological [SEP]
[CLS] laughed guys [SEP] and so, we think this is a situation where the software can actually build its own hardware in a biological system. [SEP] wanted build cassettes larger chromosome letters code entire bacterial genetic [SEP]
[CLS] system situation software build hardware biological [SEP] but we wanted to go much larger: we wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosome -- it's over 580,000 letters of genetic code -- so we thought we'd build them in cassettes the size of the viruses so we could actually vary the cassettes to understand what the actual components of a living cell are. [SEP] digital information design critical computer accurate starting [SEP]
[CLS] wanted build cassettes larger chromosome letters code entire bacterial genetic [SEP] design is critical, and if you're starting with digital information in the computer, that digital information has to be really accurate. [SEP] base pairs sequenced genome standard accuracy error [SEP]
[CLS] digital information design critical computer accurate starting [SEP] when we first sequenced this genome in 1995, the standard of accuracy was one error per 10,000 base pairs. [SEP] errors found sequence resequencing original booted [SEP]
[CLS] base pairs sequenced genome standard accuracy error [SEP] we actually found, on resequencing it, 30 errors; had we used that original sequence, it never would have been able to be booted up. [SEP] design pieces part letters designing long overlap build smaller subunits [SEP]
[CLS] errors found sequence resequencing original booted [SEP] part of the design is designing pieces that are 50 letters long that have to overlap with all the other 50-letter pieces to build smaller subunits we have to design so they can go together. [SEP] design unique elements [SEP]
[CLS] design pieces part letters designing long overlap build smaller subunits [SEP] we design unique elements into this. [SEP] read put watermarks [SEP]
[CLS] design unique elements [SEP] you may have read that we put watermarks in. [SEP] code four-letter genetic [SEP]
[CLS] read put watermarks [SEP] think of this: we have a four-letter genetic code -- a, c, g and t. [SEP] acids amino triplets roughly code single designation letters letter [SEP]
[CLS] code four-letter genetic [SEP] triplets of those letters code for roughly 20 amino acids, such that there's a single letter designation for each of the amino acids. [SEP] sentences thoughts words genetic code write [SEP]
[CLS] acids amino triplets roughly code single designation letters letter [SEP] so we can use the genetic code to write out words, sentences, thoughts. [SEP] initially autograph [SEP]
[CLS] sentences thoughts words genetic code write [SEP] initially, all we did was autograph it. [SEP] poetry people disappointed [SEP]
[CLS] initially autograph [SEP] some people were disappointed there was not poetry. [SEP] enzymes designed pieces chew back repair put [SEP]
[CLS] poetry people disappointed [SEP] we designed these pieces so we can just chew back with enzymes; there are enzymes that repair them and put them together. [SEP] letters pieces starting make put started making sets [SEP]
[CLS] enzymes designed pieces chew back repair put [SEP] and we started making pieces, starting with pieces that were 5,000 to 7,000 letters, put those together to make 24,000-letter pieces, then put sets of those going up to 72,000. [SEP] stage minute grew pieces abundance sequence create process extremely robust [SEP]
[CLS] letters pieces starting make put started making sets [SEP] at each stage, we grew up these pieces in abundance so we could sequence them because we're trying to create a process that's extremely robust that you can see in a minute. [SEP] automation point [SEP]
[CLS] stage minute grew pieces abundance sequence create process extremely robust [SEP] we're trying to get to the point of automation. [SEP] playoff basketball [SEP]
[CLS] automation point [SEP] so, this looks like a basketball playoff. [SEP] base pairs coli biology mechanisms large pieces longer grow readily [SEP]
[CLS] playoff basketball [SEP] when we get into these really large pieces over 100,000 base pairs, they won't any longer grow readily in e. coli -- it exhausts all the modern tools of molecular biology -- and so we turned to other mechanisms. [SEP] knew mechanism called homologous recombination biology repair dna put pieces [SEP]
[CLS] base pairs coli biology mechanisms large pieces longer grow readily [SEP] we knew there's a mechanism called homologous recombination that biology uses to repair dna that can put pieces together. [SEP] radiation organism called deinococcus radiodurans millions rads [SEP]
[CLS] knew mechanism called homologous recombination biology repair dna put pieces [SEP] here's an example of it: there's an organism called deinococcus radiodurans that can take three millions rads of radiation. [SEP] panel top chromosome blown [SEP]
[CLS] radiation organism called deinococcus radiodurans millions rads [SEP] you can see in the top panel, its chromosome just gets blown apart. [SEP] twelve hours put back [SEP]
[CLS] panel top chromosome blown [SEP] twelve to 24 hours later, it put it back together exactly as it was before. [SEP] thousands organisms [SEP]
[CLS] twelve hours put back [SEP] we have thousands of organisms that can do this. [SEP] desiccated vacuum organisms totally live [SEP]
[CLS] thousands organisms [SEP] these organisms can be totally desiccated; they can live in a vacuum. [SEP] space move find environment absolutely life exist outer aqueous [SEP]

[CLS] font spacing pages code printed print genetic [SEP] well, how do we boot up a chromosome? how do we activate this? [SEP] simple bacteria virus pretty complicated dealing [SEP]
[CLS] chromosome boot activate [SEP] obviously, with a virus it's pretty simple; it's much more complicated dealing with bacteria. [SEP] pop cloning simpler eukaryotes nucleus heard [SEP]
[CLS] simple bacteria virus pretty complicated dealing [SEP] it's also simpler when you go into eukaryotes like ourselves: you can just pop out the nucleus and pop in another one, and that's what you've all heard about with cloning. [SEP] archaea chromosome cell bacteria integrated recently showed complete transplant activate [SEP]
[CLS] pop cloning simpler eukaryotes nucleus heard [SEP] with bacteria and archaea, the chromosome is integrated into the cell, but we recently showed that we can do a complete transplant of a chromosome from one cell to another and activate it. [SEP] roughly chromosome species mice proteins cell purified microbial distant human [SEP]
[CLS] archaea chromosome cell bacteria integrated recently showed complete transplant activate [SEP] we purified a chromosome from one microbial species -- roughly, these two are as distant as human and mice -- we added a few extra genes so we could select for this chromosome, we digested it with enzymes to kill all the proteins, and it was pretty stunning when we put this in the cell -- and you'll appreciate our very sophisticated graphics here.

[CLS] fact thought design process bit [SEP] this is a major mechanism of evolution right here. [SEP] species adding find kinds chromosome thousands traits [SEP]
[CLS] major mechanism evolution [SEP] we find all kinds of species that have taken up a second chromosome or a third one from somewhere, adding thousands of new traits in a second to that species. [SEP] people biology evolution gene changing time missed [SEP]
[CLS] species adding find kinds chromosome thousands traits [SEP] so, people who think of evolution as just one gene changing at a time have missed much of biology. [SEP] dna enzymes called restriction digest [SEP]
[CLS] people biology evolution gene changing time missed [SEP] there are enzymes called restriction enzymes that actually digest dna. [SEP] chromosome cell put [SEP]
[CLS] dna enzymes called restriction digest [SEP] the chromosome that was in the cell doesn't have one; the chromosome we put in does. [SEP] chromosome material chewed expressed recognized foreign ended cell [SEP]
[CLS] chromosome cell put [SEP] it got expressed and it recognized the other chromosome as foreign material, chewed it up, and so we ended up just with a cell with the new chromosome. [SEP] turned blue genes put [SEP]
[CLS] chromosome material chewed expressed recognized foreign ended cell [SEP] it turned blue because of the genes we put in it. [SEP] species time cell short period characteristics lost converted totally based [SEP]
[CLS] turned blue genes put [SEP] and with a very short period of time, all the characteristics of one species were lost and it converted totally into the new species based on the new software that we put in the cell. [SEP] changed code proteins membranes read genetic transferred [SEP]
[CLS] species time cell short period characteristics lost converted totally based [SEP] all the proteins changed, the membranes changed; when we read the genetic code, it's exactly what we had transferred in. [SEP] alchemy change dramatically sound genomic moving software dna things [SEP]
[CLS] changed code proteins membranes read genetic transferred [SEP] so, this may sound like genomic alchemy, but we can, by moving the software of dna around, change things quite dramatically. [SEP] argued genesis evolution building half billion years [SEP]
[CLS] alchemy change dramatically sound genomic moving software dna things [SEP] now i've argued, this is not genesis; this is building on three and a half billion years of evolution. [SEP] explosion design argued create version cambrian massive speciation based digital [SEP]

[CLS] recently corn experiment ethanol bad [SEP] we have second- and third-generation fuels that will be coming out relatively soon that are sugar, to much higher-value fuels like octane or different types of butanol. [SEP] feedstock road biology major impact increasing cost food limiting availability [SEP]
[CLS] sugar butanol fuels third-generation coming higher-value octane types [SEP] but the only way we think that biology can have a major impact without further increasing the cost of food and limiting its availability is if we start with co2 as its feedstock, and so we're working with designing cells to go down this road.

[CLS]  [SEP] we need to go far, quickly. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] quickly [SEP] thank you very much. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] i want to start out by asking you to think back to when you were a kid, playing with blocks. [SEP] grasp pick relationships figured reach move learning solve problems understanding [SEP]
[CLS] kid playing blocks start back [SEP] as you figured out how to reach out and grasp, pick them up and move them around, you were actually learning how to think and solve problems by understanding and manipulating spatial relationships. [SEP] spatial reasoning deeply connected understand lot world [SEP]
[CLS] grasp pick relationships figured reach move learning solve problems understanding [SEP] spatial reasoning is deeply connected to how we understand a lot of the world around us. [SEP] computer objects pattie kalanithi desktop physically arranging wanted scientist inspired [SEP]
[CLS] spatial reasoning deeply connected understand lot world [SEP] so, as a computer scientist inspired by this utility of our interactions with physical objects -- along with my adviser pattie, and my collaborator jeevan kalanithi -- i started to wonder -- what if when we used a computer, instead of having this one mouse cursor that was a like a digital fingertip moving around a flat desktop, what if we could reach in with both hands and grasp information physically, arranging it the way we wanted? [SEP] answer siftables question compelling decided explore building [SEP]
[CLS] computer objects pattie kalanithi desktop physically arranging wanted scientist inspired [SEP] this question was so compelling that we decided to explore the answer, by building siftables. [SEP] nutshell cookie siftable interactive computer size [SEP]
[CLS] answer siftables question compelling decided explore building [SEP] in a nutshell, a siftable is an interactive computer the size of a cookie. [SEP] sense hand motion radio moved screen wireless [SEP]
[CLS] nutshell cookie siftable interactive computer size [SEP] they're able to be moved around by hand, they can sense each other, they can sense their motion, and they have a screen and a wireless radio. [SEP] importantly physical blocks grasping move reaching [SEP]
[CLS] sense hand motion radio moved screen wireless [SEP] most importantly, they're physical, so like the blocks, you can move them just by reaching out and grasping. [SEP] information siftables ecosystem tools manipulating digital [SEP]
[CLS] importantly physical blocks grasping move reaching [SEP] and siftables are an example of a new ecosystem of tools for manipulating digital information. [SEP] aware physical motion styles tools nuance move start explore fun [SEP]
[CLS] information siftables ecosystem tools manipulating digital [SEP] and as these tools become more physical, more aware of their motion, aware of each other, and aware of the nuance of how we move them, we can start to explore some new and fun interaction styles. [SEP] start simple [SEP]
[CLS] aware physical motion styles tools nuance move start explore fun [SEP] so, i'm going to start with some simple examples. [SEP] tilt video direction backwards roll rolls siftable configured show [SEP]
[CLS] start simple [SEP] this siftable is configured to show video, and if i tilt it in one direction, it'll roll the video this way; if i tilt it the other way it rolls it backwards. [SEP] interactive portraits aware [SEP]
[CLS] tilt video direction backwards roll rolls siftable configured show [SEP] and these interactive portraits are aware of each other. [SEP] interested put [SEP]
[CLS] interactive portraits aware [SEP] so if i put them next to each other, they get interested. [SEP] surrounded flustered notice [SEP]
[CLS] interested put [SEP] if they get surrounded, they notice that too, they might get a little flustered. [SEP] tilt sense motion [SEP]
[CLS] surrounded flustered notice [SEP] and they can also sense their motion and tilt. [SEP] interaction realize data liquid interesting implications started everyday gestures pouring [SEP]
[CLS] tilt sense motion [SEP] one of the interesting implications on interaction, we started to realize, was that we could use everyday gestures on data, like pouring a color the way we might pour a liquid. [SEP] case mixed siftables configured paint buckets pour color central [SEP]
[CLS] interaction realize data liquid interesting implications started everyday gestures pouring [SEP] so in this case, we've got three siftables configured to be paint buckets and i can use them to pour color into that central one, where they get mixed. [SEP] overshoot back pour bit [SEP]
[CLS] case mixed siftables configured paint buckets pour color central [SEP] if we overshoot, we can pour a little bit back. [SEP] education language math quickly immediately neat possibilities logic games give [SEP]
[CLS] overshoot back pour bit [SEP] there are also some neat possibilities for education, like language, math and logic games where we want to give people the ability to try things quickly, and view the results immediately. [SEP] program fibonacci sequence making simple equation [SEP]
[CLS] education language math quickly immediately neat possibilities logic games give [SEP] so here i'm -- this is a fibonacci sequence that i'm making with a simple equation program. [SEP] boggle word game kind mash-up scrabble [SEP]
[CLS] program fibonacci sequence making simple equation [SEP] here we have a word game that's kind of like a mash-up between scrabble and boggle. [SEP] basically siftable dictionary round randomly assigned letter make words checks [SEP]
[CLS] boggle word game kind mash-up scrabble [SEP] basically, in every round you get a randomly assigned letter on each siftable, and as you try to make words it checks against a dictionary. [SEP] reshuffles set letters possibilities [SEP]
[CLS] basically siftable dictionary round randomly assigned letter make words checks [SEP] then, after about 30 seconds, it reshuffles, and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] reshuffles set letters possibilities [SEP] thank you. [SEP] lab video kids field trip media managed shoot [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] so these are some kids that came on a field trip to the media lab, and i managed to get them to try it out, and shoot a video. [SEP] loved [SEP]
[CLS] lab video kids field trip media managed shoot [SEP] they really loved it. [SEP] instructions interesting things kind application give people [SEP]
[CLS] loved [SEP] and, one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don't have to give people many instructions. [SEP] make words [SEP]
[CLS] instructions interesting things kind application give people [SEP] all you have to say is, "make words," and they know exactly what to do. [SEP] people [SEP]
[CLS] make words [SEP] so here's another few people trying it out. [SEP] tester youngest beta [SEP]
[CLS] people [SEP] that's our youngest beta tester, down there on the right. [SEP] turns wanted stack siftables [SEP]
[CLS] tester youngest beta [SEP] turns out, all he wanted to do was to stack the siftables up. [SEP] blocks [SEP]
[CLS] turns wanted stack siftables [SEP] so to him, they were just blocks. [SEP] application interactive cartoon [SEP]
[CLS] blocks [SEP] now, this is an interactive cartoon application. [SEP] learners wanted build learning tool language [SEP]
[CLS] application interactive cartoon [SEP] and we wanted to build a learning tool for language learners. [SEP] felix [SEP]
[CLS] learners wanted build learning tool language [SEP] and this is felix, actually. [SEP] scene bring lifting siftables table shown characters character [SEP]
[CLS] felix [SEP] and he can bring new characters into the scene, just by lifting the siftables off the table that have that character shown on them. [SEP] bringing sun [SEP]
[CLS] scene bring lifting siftables table shown characters character [SEP] here, he's bringing the sun out. [SEP] rising sun [SEP]
[CLS] bringing sun [SEP] the sun is rising. [SEP] scene brought tractor [SEP]
[CLS] rising sun [SEP] now he's brought a tractor into the scene. [SEP] tractor orange [SEP]
[CLS] scene brought tractor [SEP] the orange tractor. [SEP] yeah good job [SEP]
[CLS] tractor orange [SEP] good job! yeah! [SEP] woof interact shaking siftables putting make characters [SEP]
[CLS] yeah good job [SEP] so by shaking the siftables and putting them next to each other he can make the characters interact -- woof! [SEP] inventing narrative [SEP]
[CLS] woof interact shaking siftables putting make characters [SEP] inventing his own narrative. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] inventing narrative [SEP] hello! [SEP] story unfolds open-ended decide [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] it's an open-ended story, and he gets to decide how it unfolds. [SEP] cat fly [SEP]
[CLS] story unfolds open-ended decide [SEP] fly away, cat. [SEP] recently lead bass drums time show today music sequencing live [SEP]
[CLS] cat fly [SEP] so, the last example i have time to show you today is a music sequencing and live performance tool that we've built recently, in which siftables act as sounds like lead, bass and drums. [SEP] variations choose [SEP]
[CLS] recently lead bass drums time show today music sequencing live [SEP] each of these has four different variations, you get to choose which one you want to use. [SEP] inject sounds sequence assemble pattern [SEP]
[CLS] variations choose [SEP] and you can inject these sounds into a sequence that you can assemble into the pattern that you want. [SEP] siftable inject bumping sound sequence [SEP]
[CLS] inject sounds sequence assemble pattern [SEP] and you inject it by just bumping up the sound siftable against a sequence siftable. [SEP] live filter effects control reverb [SEP]
[CLS] siftable inject bumping sound sequence [SEP] there are effects that you can control live, like reverb and filter. [SEP] attach sound tilt adjust [SEP]
[CLS] live filter effects control reverb [SEP] you attach it to a particular sound and then tilt to adjust it. [SEP] sequence effects tempo volume apply entire [SEP]
[CLS] attach sound tilt adjust [SEP] and then, overall effects like tempo and volume that apply to the entire sequence. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] sequence effects tempo volume apply entire [SEP] so let's have a look. [SEP] lead siftables arrange series extend add start putting sequence [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] we'll start by putting a lead into two sequence siftables, arrange them into a series, extend it, add a little more lead. [SEP] put bass line [SEP]
[CLS] lead siftables arrange series extend add start putting sequence [SEP] now i put a bass line in. [SEP] put percussion [SEP]
[CLS] put bass line [SEP] now i'll put some percussion in. [SEP] drums live attach filter control effect [SEP]
[CLS] put percussion [SEP] and now i'll attach the filter to the drums, so i can control the effect live. [SEP] speed sequence tilting tempo [SEP]
[CLS] drums live attach filter control effect [SEP] i can speed up the whole sequence by tilting the tempo one way or the other. [SEP] expression attach filter bass [SEP]
[CLS] speed sequence tilting tempo [SEP] and now i'll attach the filter to the bass for some more expression. [SEP] plays rearrange sequence [SEP]
[CLS] expression attach filter bass [SEP] i can rearrange the sequence while it plays. [SEP] advance improvise making plan longer shorter [SEP]
[CLS] plays rearrange sequence [SEP] so i don't have to plan it out in advance, but i can improvise, making it longer or shorter as i go. [SEP] finally siftable tilted left fade sequence volume [SEP]
[CLS] advance improvise making plan longer shorter [SEP] and now, finally, i can fade the whole sequence out using the volume siftable, tilted to the left. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] finally siftable tilted left fade sequence volume [SEP] thank you. [SEP] work passion making human-computer interfaces match brains bodies [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] so, as you can see, my passion is for making new human-computer interfaces that are a better match to the ways our brains and bodies work. [SEP] today space laboratory time show point design possibilities working bring [SEP]
[CLS] work passion making human-computer interfaces match brains bodies [SEP] and today, i had time to show you one point in this new design space, and a few of the possibilities that we're working to bring out of the laboratory. [SEP] terms thought leave cusp generation tools interacting digital media bring [SEP]
[CLS] today space laboratory time show point design possibilities working bring [SEP] so the thought i want to leave you with is that we're on the cusp of this new generation of tools for interacting with digital media that are going to bring information into our world on our terms. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] terms thought leave cusp generation tools interacting digital media bring [SEP] thank you very much. [SEP] forward talking [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] i look forward to talking with all of you. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] yes, hello. [SEP] happy [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] i'm happy to be here. [SEP] biohacking [SEP]
[CLS] happy [SEP] yes, so, what is biohacking? [SEP] biohacking biology provide background information deals modern molecular [SEP]
[CLS] biohacking [SEP] i'll have to provide some background information here, biohacking deals with modern molecular biology. [SEP] wanted practice study molecular biology research biohacking years started simply [SEP]
[CLS] biohacking biology provide background information deals modern molecular [SEP] i study molecular biology and have been doing research into biohacking for a few years now, i started doing this because i simply wanted to have more detailed knowledge and especially wanted to put what i'd learned theoretically into practice. [SEP] motives prime [SEP]
[CLS] wanted practice study molecular biology research biohacking years started simply [SEP] so these were my prime motives. [SEP] material curiosity wanted closer [SEP]
[CLS] motives prime [SEP] so it was curiosity and i somehow wanted to get closer to the material, that was it. [SEP] biology general biotechnology molecular generally speaking included synthetic [SEP]
[CLS] material curiosity wanted closer [SEP] i think that molecular biology in general, so generally speaking biotechnology, everything that can be included in that, like synthetic biology, etc. [SEP] future today important extreme importance extremely [SEP]
[CLS] biology general biotechnology molecular generally speaking included synthetic [SEP] is of extreme importance today is already extremely important today and will become much more important in the future. [SEP] fields controversial topics genetically modified plants [SEP]
[CLS] future today important extreme importance extremely [SEP] there are controversial topics such as all those genetically modified plants in the fields. [SEP] biofuel biodiesel algae craig venter usa produce fuel made [SEP]
[CLS] fields controversial topics genetically modified plants [SEP] now there's craig venter in the usa who's trying to produce biofuel, biodiesel fuel made from algae. [SEP] enzymes life degrees things part everyday people aware washing powder [SEP]
[CLS] biofuel biodiesel algae craig venter usa produce fuel made [SEP] and then there are things that have already become part of everyday life, although most people are not aware of it, such as washing powder enzymes, which allow us to wash clothes at forty degrees, which are also genetically optimised enzymes. [SEP] forever list [SEP]
[CLS] enzymes life degrees things part everyday people aware washing powder [SEP] and the list can go on forever. [SEP] technology interest delved [SEP]
[CLS] forever list [SEP] and so because of my interest in the in this technology, i went delved into it more. [SEP] hacking [SEP]
[CLS] technology interest delved [SEP] so what why hacking? [SEP] software people heard context [SEP]
[CLS] hacking [SEP] most of us know most people have heard of this in the context of software. [SEP] computer hacking hackers media break place steal data [SEP]
[CLS] software people heard context [SEP] computer hacking, and then in the media it's yes, hackers break into a place and steal data and so on. [SEP] community sad hacker fully describe started [SEP]
[CLS] computer hacking hackers media break place steal data [SEP] that's rather sad for the hacker community, because it doesn't at all fully describe what they actually how it actually all started and what's behind it. [SEP] software internet hackers started building computers seventies eighties gave rise [SEP]
[CLS] community sad hacker fully describe started [SEP] software hackers started building computers in the seventies and eighties and this gave rise to the internet. [SEP] creative playful original deals problem-solving [SEP]
[CLS] software internet hackers started building computers seventies eighties gave rise [SEP] and it deals with problem-solving in a playful, creative, original way. [SEP] problem things question technical social access simplifying posing differently [SEP]
[CLS] creative playful original deals problem-solving [SEP] and a problem, so not only a technical problem, it can also be a social problem, it can also just be an access problem that simplifying things, so any way of looking at a problem, of posing a question, asking how you could do something differently or better. [SEP] software scene circuits developed area found electronics sector find tinkerer [SEP]
[CLS] problem things question technical social access simplifying posing differently [SEP] and it was it developed in the area of software, but it's also found in the electronics sector where you also find a whole tinkerer scene, which makes all sorts of crazy things with electrical circuits. [SEP] material biology code computer dynamic cybernetic find metaphor synthetic information [SEP]
[CLS] software scene circuits developed area found electronics sector find tinkerer [SEP] and so now you find it in biology, and i'd like to take a metaphor from synthetic biology, biology is actually an information science because the dna code is an abstract code that yes, it's not exactly like a computer, because it's more dynamic, because it's material, i mean real material, and not just cybernetic. [SEP] code fascinating program hack thought incredibly wanted delve [SEP]
[CLS] material biology code computer dynamic cybernetic find metaphor synthetic information [SEP] but it's also a code, and you can program that and so you can also hack into it, that's it, and i thought think it's incredibly fascinating, and i just wanted to really delve into that. [SEP] networks form thousand [SEP]
[CLS] code fascinating program hack thought incredibly wanted delve [SEP] these these networks didn't really take form until two thousand eight. [SEP] org switzerland india hackteria dot originally network based europe cooperation [SEP]
[CLS] networks form thousand [SEP] there's hackteria dot org, which originally comes from switzerland, and it's a network based in europe with a cooperation in india, but it has members and active people all over the world by now. [SEP] character working scientists creatively things arty artists philosophers examining technologies [SEP]
[CLS] org switzerland india hackteria dot originally network based europe cooperation [SEP] those are it has a more arty character, so it's many artists and philosophers are working, together with scientists, on examining these technologies and asking questions and processing the knowledge creatively, there are museum exhibitions and, well, all sorts of things. [SEP] playfully point find loose approach deal [SEP]
[CLS] character working scientists creatively things arty artists philosophers examining technologies [SEP] but the point is to always find a a really loose approach to it, to deal with it playfully. [SEP] dot-org diy bio [SEP]
[CLS] playfully point find loose approach deal [SEP] and then there's do-it-yourself-bio- dot-org, diy bio. [SEP] usa forum online network kind people meet discuss things [SEP]
[CLS] dot-org diy bio [SEP] that's a network from the usa, that's more of a kind of a forum, where you where people can meet and discuss things online. [SEP] practical asked geared technical business aspects questions [SEP]
[CLS] usa forum online network kind people meet discuss things [SEP] they are geared more towards the technical as well as the business aspects of it, and so you see more, well, practical questions being asked. [SEP] based networks popular describe made thing scene briefly [SEP]
[CLS] practical asked geared technical business aspects questions [SEP] based on these networks, which made the whole thing popular, a scene came into being, which i'd like to briefly describe. [SEP] school biocurious hackerspace institution picture left kind private non-profit organisation [SEP]
[CLS] based networks popular describe made thing scene briefly [SEP] this picture on the left is of biocurious, that's a hackerspace, so a kind of school, a private school, a non-profit organisation institution, where anybody can go to.

[CLS] indonesia house called time bottom left group natural fibers [SEP] for a longer time than these other two networks. [SEP] tinkering biological materials artistic electronic combine outlandish [SEP]
[CLS] networks longer time [SEP] they look at biological materials in an artistic way and, yes, also electronic tinkering, and combine this in a very outlandish way. [SEP] group ankara ago university people contact student wanted inform public [SEP]
[CLS] tinkering biological materials artistic electronic combine outlandish [SEP] a group from ankara, that i came into contact with a while ago, they have they are a student group that wanted to inform the public more about what what they learn about at university, and they organised these these little actions at street festivals and tried to explain dna to people. [SEP] topic image top lecture copenhagen medical museion combination exhibition [SEP]
[CLS] group ankara ago university people contact student wanted inform public [SEP] and in this other image at the top i have a lecture in in copenhagen at the medical museion in combination with an exhibition on the topic. [SEP] people technology young thing unites fascination [SEP]
[CLS] topic image top lecture copenhagen medical museion combination exhibition [SEP] and that's, well that's these are usually really young people, but the only thing that that one that really unites everybody, is this fascination with technology. [SEP] involved approaching society targetedly interested [SEP]
[CLS] people technology young thing unites fascination [SEP] and what you can do with it and approaching society very targetedly and asking, right, okay, what do you know, what what do you want to get involved in, are you interested in getting involved in this way? [SEP] biology material hack [SEP]
[CLS] involved approaching society targetedly interested [SEP] so, okay, to hack into biology, you need material. [SEP] materials tools laboratory biological [SEP]
[CLS] biology material hack [SEP] you need biological materials, but you also need tools, and that's a laboratory. [SEP] extremely laboratory machines staff trained understand cool expensive distant professional [SEP]
[CLS] materials tools laboratory biological [SEP] or what you would normally understand to be a laboratory, so some cool machines, extremely expensive ones, extremely distant ones, for professional staff, trained academics with a doctor's degree etc. only. [SEP] approach [SEP]
[CLS] extremely laboratory machines staff trained understand cool expensive distant professional [SEP] and our approach was to say, okay, that you don't actually have to do that. [SEP] fact devices true coffee machine advanced technology laboratory [SEP]
[CLS] approach [SEP] that's not necessary in fact, because every every every coffee machine actually uses more advanced technology than most laboratory devices, that's really true. [SEP] premises brian england mini-laboratory cooker soup stock working degger set [SEP]
[CLS] fact devices true coffee machine advanced technology laboratory [SEP] and so with this premises with this premises, brian degger in england, for example, tried to set up a mini-laboratory, took a pressure cooker, a hot plate and, yes, soup stock, and bred bacteria with it, working like this. [SEP] bad long soup left standing [SEP]
[CLS] premises brian england mini-laboratory cooker soup stock working degger set [SEP] so anybody who's ever had a soup gone go bad, because they left it standing for too long, has already done this. [SEP] home dna analysis test words expand laboratory back bought secondhand [SEP]
[CLS] bad long soup left standing [SEP] i then tried to expand this at my laboratory back home, and so i bought some secondhand equipment on ebay and did a little dna analysis, and tried to do a paternity test, so dna fingerprinting in other words, at home again. [SEP] laboratory set joke marks supposed image quotation closed garage equipment [SEP]
[CLS] home dna analysis test words expand laboratory back bought secondhand [SEP] that's not supposed to be a joke, but here in the image below you can see there's the laboratory, in quotation marks, so a closed up garage with all this laboratory equipment that the university got rid of, a group in paris that set something set up something and is very successful with it and does some really interesting things there. i'd like to briefly mention a project. [SEP] biocurious basically biology hackerspace mentioned kind adult education centre molecular [SEP]
[CLS] laboratory set joke marks supposed image quotation closed garage equipment [SEP] that here is biocurious, the hackerspace i mentioned just now, this yes, basically a kind of adult education centre for for molecular biology. [SEP] thing home larger organisations heterogeneous people big formally institutionalised form [SEP]
[CLS] biocurious basically biology hackerspace mentioned kind adult education centre molecular [SEP] and yes, so you can see that it's a relatively relatively heterogeneous thing, so from some people who do it on their own from home, to big i mean, larger organisations, who are doing this more formally in an institutionalised form already. [SEP] approach accessible simple [SEP]
[CLS] thing home larger organisations heterogeneous people big formally institutionalised form [SEP] but always always with this this approach, that it should be simple and accessible. [SEP] scene group real online project international aware exist people chatting [SEP]
[CLS] approach accessible simple [SEP] the first project that we did as an international group, when we became aware of ourselves, you might say, okay we exist as a real “scene ”, and we're online, and we we know the people who are always chatting there and everything. [SEP] dot founder org [SEP]
[CLS] scene group real online project international aware exist people chatting [SEP] and then the founder of do-it-yourself-bio dot org came and said: okay [SEP] meet personally events london ten usa francisco organised thousand shortly [SEP]
[CLS] dot founder org [SEP] we really need to meet up now, meet up personally, and he organised two events, one in london, in two thousand ten, and shortly after that in the usa, in san francisco. [SEP] focus talk [SEP]
[CLS] meet personally events london ten usa francisco organised thousand shortly [SEP] and, the focus there was on, so okay, who are we, what do we want, what do we also want what do we want to talk about? [SEP] objectives principles fundamental [SEP]
[CLS] focus talk [SEP] and what what are our values and what are what are our objectives, our fundamental principles? [SEP] conduct worked writing kind code [SEP]
[CLS] objectives principles fundamental [SEP] and then we worked on writing up a kind of code of conduct. [SEP] intuitive wishes expressed things move [SEP]
[CLS] conduct worked writing kind code [SEP] that was really intuitive, i mean, everyone expressed their wishes, their and things that move them. [SEP] opinion created good code [SEP]
[CLS] intuitive wishes expressed things move [SEP] then, in my opinion, a really good code was created. [SEP] binding people managed accepted convinced [SEP]
[CLS] opinion created good code [SEP] and that was then it's not binding, but it's yes, i think it has managed to become accepted quite well, people are quite convinced about it, yes. [SEP] world bring back academic received [SEP]
[CLS] binding people managed accepted convinced [SEP] and then we even tried to bring it back into the academic world, but somehow it wasn't really well received there. [SEP] sense world biohacker scene step academic [SEP]
[CLS] world bring back academic received [SEP] so i think we from the biohacker scene have, in that sense, gone a step further than the the academic world. [SEP] sort projects work [SEP]
[CLS] sense world biohacker scene step academic [SEP] yes, what sort of projects do we actually work on? [SEP] switzerland tweezers optical project set hackteria network wanted create so-called [SEP]
[CLS] sort projects work [SEP] a project i set up myself with the hackteria network in switzerland, was one in which we wanted to create a so-called optical trap or optical tweezers. [SEP] focus beam space laser catch particles air liquid move trapped [SEP]
[CLS] switzerland tweezers optical project set hackteria network wanted create so-called [SEP] this is when you focus a laser beam on a in a space, and then you can catch little particles in the air with it or in in liquid and then move them in this focus, so, they're then trapped in there, so it's basically like a tractor beam.

[CLS] focus beam space laser catch particles air liquid move trapped [SEP] that really works, it's done in an academic setting, and then we thought, okay, we might manage that, and took a webcam, dismantled it, took off the lens, turned it around and then we have a microscope, which has a four hundred fold magnification approximately. [SEP] bottom [SEP]
[CLS] works setting thought webcam dismantled lens turned microscope approximately academic [SEP] you can see this at the bottom. [SEP] burner camera dvd laser focus [SEP]
[CLS] bottom [SEP] and then we took apart a dvd burner and took out the burner the laser and then tried to focus on this camera. [SEP] work learned lot [SEP]
[CLS] burner camera dvd laser focus [SEP] and unfortunately that didn't work, but we learned a lot in doing so anyhow. [SEP] project paris work cool french group pretty [SEP]
[CLS] work learned lot [SEP] another project, that came from from the french group in paris, did work, and that's pretty cool. [SEP] waves neurobiology neurohack devices measure brain eeg working nickname sam [SEP]
[CLS] project paris work cool french group pretty [SEP] he took one of these well, one of these one of these devices that measure brain waves, an eeg or something like that, so he was working with neurobiology, his his nickname is sam neurohack. [SEP] helmet museum made place cooperation [SEP]
[CLS] waves neurobiology neurohack devices measure brain eeg working nickname sam [SEP] he then made this this this helmet, and it took place in in cooperation with the museum. [SEP] visitors room sit chair helmet put [SEP]
[CLS] helmet museum made place cooperation [SEP] visitors could go into the room, sit down on this chair, and put on this helmet. [SEP] thought measured brain waves depending lights roomwent switched [SEP]
[CLS] visitors room sit chair helmet put [SEP] their brain waves were then measured, and depending on what they thought about or how they thought, different lights in the roomwent switched on. [SEP] project fancy [SEP]
[CLS] thought measured brain waves depending lights roomwent switched [SEP] was a very a very fancy project. [SEP] thing pcr reaction term usa paternity test polymerase chain complicated [SEP]
[CLS] project fancy [SEP] another thing from the usa that also had to do with paternity test thing, is the the pcr, the polymerase chain reaction, a complicated term. [SEP] dna fragments genes replicating visible copying make [SEP]
[CLS] thing pcr reaction term usa paternity test polymerase chain complicated [SEP] this is about the copying of genes, replicating genes, dna, fragments, so that you can make them visible. [SEP] hair scene collect samples method person profilers crime make implement [SEP]
[CLS] dna fragments genes replicating visible copying make [SEP] so when i now that's what the what profilers do at a crime scene, they go there, collect some hair samples, and then they make these implement this method, and then they can say, okay, this hair belongs to this person, like that. [SEP] expensive commercially machines buy start thousand euros [SEP]
[CLS] hair scene collect samples method person profilers crime make implement [SEP] and the machines that do that are rather expensive, the ones you buy commercially, they start at about four thousand euros at the least. [SEP] amateurs technology lot range cool capable [SEP]
[CLS] expensive commercially machines buy start thousand euros [SEP] and that's not within the range of amateurs, but it's a really cool technology, which is capable of a lot. [SEP] application [SEP]
[CLS] amateurs technology lot range cool capable [SEP] so that's just one application among many that you can use. [SEP] make cheaper stuff worldwide tinkerers work easier put piece equipment [SEP]
[CLS] application [SEP] and they have there were two two tinkerers who went to work on it and said, okay, we can make this easier and cheaper, and put together this this piece of equipment from open source stuff, so freely available hardware and electronics and they're now the they've now managed to make it ripe for the market and are currently the the cheapest providers of these devices worldwide. [SEP] price lies hundred dollars [SEP]
[CLS] make cheaper stuff worldwide tinkerers work easier put piece equipment [SEP] i think the price lies at about six hundred dollars or so. [SEP] cheap accessible range makes [SEP]
[CLS] price lies hundred dollars [SEP] it's certainly now it's that's still not cheap, but it's certainly within a range that makes it much more accessible. [SEP] opinion successful hack [SEP]
[CLS] cheap accessible range makes [SEP] so that was a very successful hack in my opinion. [SEP] gun project recently started building gene [SEP]
[CLS] opinion successful hack [SEP] a project i recently started was the building of a gene gun. [SEP] gun gene kind air pressure shoots centimetres [SEP]
[CLS] gun project recently started building gene [SEP] a gene gun is, well, a kind of air pressure gun, which shoots about this far, two centimetres or so. [SEP] gold particles gun charge dna put air pressure shot onions [SEP]
[CLS] gun gene kind air pressure shoots centimetres [SEP] you charge gold particles with dna and then put these gold particles into this air pressure gun, and then i shot at onions and made them light up and stuff like that. [SEP] work device [SEP]
[CLS] gold particles gun charge dna put air pressure shot onions [SEP] so the device you see here didn't work. [SEP] thing pressure prototype put high broke looked pretty wild branch [SEP]
[CLS] work device [SEP] but that's my my prototype, which looked pretty wild though, on a branch and that, that thing on it, put the electronics into it and connected pressure to it and that was but the pressure was too high, and the thing broke. [SEP] whipped cream dispenser connected [SEP]
[CLS] thing pressure prototype put high broke looked pretty wild branch [SEP] then i took a whipped cream dispenser and connected it to that. [SEP] dispenser water pressure bar whipped cream fill forty sixty [SEP]
[CLS] whipped cream dispenser connected [SEP] a whipped cream dispenser, when you fill it up with water, it has enough pressure, i think about forty to sixty bar. [SEP] onions accelerate particles strongly enter [SEP]
[CLS] dispenser water pressure bar whipped cream fill forty sixty [SEP] and with that you can accelerate the particles strongly enough and then they enter the onions. [SEP] euros commercial device starts fifteen thousand whipped cream dispensers cost [SEP]
[CLS] onions accelerate particles strongly enter [SEP] and the commercial device for this starts at about fifteen thousand euros or so, whereas whipped cream dispensers cost about fifty euros. [SEP] efficient doable basically [SEP]
[CLS] euros commercial device starts fifteen thousand whipped cream dispensers cost [SEP] so the it's not as efficient, but it's basically doable. [SEP] scene making comprehensibility involved core objective technology increasing information people [SEP]
[CLS] efficient doable basically [SEP] so that's currently the the core objective of the scene, making the technology more available and increasing the information and comprehensibility, so that that more people can get involved. [SEP] beginning extremely important technology people chance educating [SEP]
[CLS] scene making comprehensibility involved core objective technology increasing information people [SEP] because as i said in the beginning, it's an extremely important technology and most people know relatively little about it and also have no chance of educating themselves really well on it. [SEP] literature read secondary [SEP]
[CLS] beginning extremely important technology people chance educating [SEP] because if you just read about it in secondary literature, that's not the same as when you've done it yourself or have seen it being done. [SEP] societies technology increasingly important modern [SEP]
[CLS] literature read secondary [SEP] and i think technology is becoming increasingly important in our modern societies. [SEP] citizen discussion technology informed make choices society part access knowledge [SEP]
[CLS] societies technology increasingly important modern [SEP] and if, as an informed citizen, you wish to make useful choices in society and want to take part in the discussion, you need access to the knowledge and the technology. [SEP] understand [SEP]
[CLS] citizen discussion technology informed make choices society part access knowledge [SEP] and and you need to do it and understand it if you want to do it and understand it. [SEP] science trades open knowledge citizen [SEP]
[CLS] understand [SEP] and this trades under the names open knowledge and citizen science. [SEP] technologies citizen put position scientific [SEP]
[CLS] science trades open knowledge citizen [SEP] so as a citizen you are put in a position where you can look into these scientific technologies. [SEP] biohackers core concern [SEP]
[CLS] technologies citizen put position scientific [SEP] and that's that's the core concern of of biohackers. [SEP] website people officially registered [SEP]
[CLS] biohackers core concern [SEP] those are the people who are at least officially registered on the website, the diy-bio-dot-org-website. [SEP] worldwide impressive number people [SEP]
[CLS] website people officially registered [SEP] there's already a rather impressive number of people worldwide. [SEP] interesting represented [SEP]
[CLS] worldwide impressive number people [SEP] and it's also interesting that they're also represented in south-east-asia. [SEP] exist people registered [SEP]
[CLS] interesting represented [SEP] that is i think they are less people have registered than actually exist. [SEP] registered people [SEP]

[CLS] function humans [SEP] this is a question that really moves me as a designer, but is also of relevance in the area of in the research area usability and especially in the area user experience. [SEP] interactive media focus approach people satisfying result [SEP]
[CLS] area designer experience question moves relevance research usability user [SEP] there, the focus is on how to approach people in interactive media, so that they can use interactive media and can come to the most satisfying result possible. [SEP] interactive media archaic cognitive address models words thought patterns programmed [SEP]
[CLS] interactive media focus approach people satisfying result [SEP] i think that interactive media address archaic, cognitive models in us, in other words thought patterns that were programmed into our biological memory a very, very long time ago and can be elicited through interactive media. [SEP] future incredible roots people advanced technology contact transports fact archaic [SEP]
[CLS] interactive media archaic cognitive address models words thought patterns programmed [SEP] and this is really incredible, because people actually believe that this advanced technology which you come into contact with there, that it transports you into the future, but in fact the future is in us, in our archaic roots. [SEP] models archaic [SEP]
[CLS] future incredible roots people advanced technology contact transports fact archaic [SEP] so what are archaic models? [SEP] briefly wrote keywords explain [SEP]
[CLS] models archaic [SEP] i wrote down four keywords and would like to explain them briefly. [SEP] archaic times models adopted pre-industrial [SEP]
[CLS] briefly wrote keywords explain [SEP] archaic models are models that we adopted in pre-industrial times. [SEP] intrinsic virtuality archaic models fact principally natural relationship [SEP]
[CLS] archaic times models adopted pre-industrial [SEP] intrinsic to these archaic models is the fact that we have a principally natural relationship with virtuality. [SEP] sound unusual [SEP]
[CLS] intrinsic virtuality archaic models fact principally natural relationship [SEP] that might sound unusual at first. [SEP] moment experiment virtuality clarify attempt prove natural relation [SEP]
[CLS] sound unusual [SEP] i will clarify this in a moment, however, and will attempt to prove by an experiment, that you, too, do have a natural relation to virtuality. [SEP] models manner today aspect archaic talk visual codified language [SEP]
[CLS] moment experiment virtuality clarify attempt prove natural relation [SEP] and the second aspect is that since we because of these archaic models, we are certainly able to talk in a very, very visual manner, although we use a codified language today. [SEP] area speaks [SEP]
[CLS] models manner today aspect archaic talk visual codified language [SEP] and the third area speaks for itself really. [SEP] non-linear definition today linearity interactive media involves negation normal [SEP]
[CLS] area speaks [SEP] we all know that interactive media is, by definition, non-linear, which involves the negation of linearity, and which of course tells us that we consider linearity normal today. [SEP] fourth point history place information passed [SEP]
[CLS] non-linear definition today linearity interactive media involves negation normal [SEP] the fourth point is that we see history as a place where information is passed on. [SEP] virtuality world natural thing [SEP]
[CLS] fourth point history place information passed [SEP] but how is it with with virtuality, which is actually the most natural thing in the world? [SEP] prove [SEP]
[CLS] virtuality world natural thing [SEP] i would like to prove that to you. [SEP] doors house live [SEP]
[CLS] prove [SEP] how many doors does the house you live in have? [SEP] spontaneously moment answer happen happening [SEP]
[CLS] doors house live [SEP] we you wouldn't be able to answer that spontaneously, but the following would happen and is happening at this very moment. [SEP] mind live walking house doors [SEP]
[CLS] spontaneously moment answer happen happening [SEP] in your mind, you are walking through the house where you live, and are seeing how many doors there are. [SEP]  [SEP]

[CLS]  [SEP] you are virtualising the reality without a computer. [SEP] fantastic [SEP]
[CLS] computer virtualising reality [SEP] fantastic, isn't it? [SEP] virtual reality campus laboratory media attempting render capable [SEP]
[CLS] fantastic [SEP] at the media campus, for example, we are attempting to render virtual reality in our virtual reality laboratory, but we have actually always been capable of this. [SEP] needed ability virtualise virtual reality people pre-industrial times bitterly [SEP]
[CLS] virtual reality campus laboratory media attempting render capable [SEP] and this this ability to virtualise the virtual reality was something that people in pre-industrial times bitterly needed, because they didn't have anything. [SEP] books [SEP]
[CLS] needed ability virtualise virtual reality people pre-industrial times bitterly [SEP] they didn't have books, after all. [SEP] photolithography [SEP]

[CLS] media mass [SEP] the only thing they had was their mind. [SEP] memory mind [SEP]
[CLS] mind thing [SEP] and in this mind they had memory. [SEP] knowledge retrieved images imagination mind virtual passed [SEP]
[CLS] memory mind [SEP] in this mind knowledge was retrieved, and with the help of these virtual images, the imagination, knowledge was was passed on too. [SEP] virtuality strongly rooted ability deal [SEP]
[CLS] knowledge retrieved images imagination mind virtual passed [SEP] and that's why it is so strongly rooted in us, this ability to deal with virtuality. [SEP] trip interesting thing make short [SEP]
[CLS] virtuality strongly rooted ability deal [SEP] the interesting thing about this is that i can make a short trip. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] trip interesting thing make short [SEP] yes, that's possible. [SEP] medium interesting thing moment human simultaneously media producer [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] the interesting thing about this is that at this moment the human was simultaneously the media producer and medium. [SEP] step [SEP]
[CLS] medium interesting thing moment human simultaneously media producer [SEP] now let's take that a step further. [SEP] today media [SEP]
[CLS] step [SEP] what is the media today? [SEP] place notice change [SEP]

[CLS] moment back [SEP] a crucial tool in information brokerage has always been stories. [SEP] shamans priests so-called stories knowledge keepers specially assigned preserve [SEP]
[CLS] stories crucial tool information brokerage [SEP] shamans, priests, so-called keepers of knowledge, were specially assigned to preserve knowledge in stories. [SEP] stories today dependent [SEP]
[CLS] shamans priests so-called stories knowledge keepers specially assigned preserve [SEP] and today we are still very, very dependent on stories. [SEP] animal jonathan gottschall stories author book storytelling spend thousand hundred [SEP]
[CLS] stories today dependent [SEP] according to the author of the book the storytelling animal, jonathan gottschall, we still spend one thousand nine hundred hours a year on the reception of stories. [SEP] majority stories child reached age legal spent life receiving [SEP]
[CLS] animal jonathan gottschall stories author book storytelling spend thousand hundred [SEP] that means that once a child has reached the the the age of legal majority, it has spent most of its life receiving stories. [SEP] parents love stories based fact sat lap [SEP]
[CLS] majority stories child reached age legal spent life receiving [SEP] now we think that our love of stories is based on the fact that we sat in the lap of our parents. [SEP]  [SEP]

[CLS] principles similar [SEP] they don't have lead maps, but used so-called songlines, or dreampaths [SEP] songs interesting thing navigation topography regions depicted [SEP]
[CLS] maps songlines dreampaths lead so-called [SEP] and the interesting thing about that is that the navigation and the topography of regions could be depicted through songs. [SEP] importance language inferior [SEP]
[CLS] songs interesting thing navigation topography regions depicted [SEP] and for them language had inferior importance. [SEP] rhythm navigated sound [SEP]
[CLS] importance language inferior [SEP] that means they navigated through the use of sound and rhythm. [SEP] point sounds rhythm depicted geology topography region made defragment songs [SEP]
[CLS] rhythm navigated sound [SEP] and these sounds and this rhythm depicted the geology and topography of a region and that of course also made it possible to defragment these songs and rearrange them so that you could move to the left and the right and could also return to the starting point.

[CLS] age abilities concepts cyber returning possibilities rediscover [SEP] this is about virtuality, about non-linearity, about storytelling. [SEP] explain [SEP]
[CLS] virtuality non-linearity storytelling [SEP] i'd like to explain that a little more. [SEP] augmented reality technical concepts [SEP]
[CLS] explain [SEP] there are technical concepts such as “augmented reality ”. [SEP] virtual world virtualisation natural google glasses concepts combine real affinity [SEP]
[CLS] augmented reality technical concepts [SEP] so if you think of the google glasses for example, then that's one of those concepts that allows us to combine the virtual world with the real world again, and so that means our affinity for virtualisation, of experiencing the virtual as something normal and natural, is being addressed again. [SEP] virtual presentation non-existent holodeck so-called reality crazy sound context physically [SEP]
[CLS] virtual world virtualisation natural google glasses concepts combine real affinity [SEP] another example is so-called virtual reality as crazy as that may of course sound in the context of my presentation, we are physically moving in non-existent, virtual worlds there, according to the example of the holodeck.

[CLS] short [SEP] you can explain this much more elaborately later on, as there's more much more to this. [SEP] twitter point game discover city places mentioned positively negatively [SEP]
[CLS] explain elaborately [SEP] the point of the game is that i discover a city by looking at which places have been mentioned positively or negatively on twitter. [SEP] city impression virtual view negative positive zones map real [SEP]
[CLS] twitter point game discover city places mentioned positively negatively [SEP] and so i can have a very different view of the city, a very different impression, because i see negative and positive zones of a city and, in this way, have a very different, virtual map of a very real city.

[CLS] children curious designers naturally [SEP] i'm a designer from birth, so of course i deal with the subject of curiosity and how curiosity in turn transforms our thinking, and why we perhaps lose our curiosity and need to give it a jolt et cetera. [SEP] designer series things concerned existence [SEP]
[CLS] curiosity birth thinking cetera designer deal subject turn transforms lose [SEP] that's a whole series of things you're concerned with besides your existence as a designer. [SEP] curious semester professors shoved research [SEP]
[CLS] designer series things concerned existence [SEP] when professors become curious, they are often shoved into a research semester. [SEP] months happened [SEP]
[CLS] curious semester professors shoved research [SEP] and that's happened to me these last six months. [SEP] design research semester topic natural user interface [SEP]
[CLS] months happened [SEP] a research semester on the topic natural user interface design. [SEP] interaction natural archaic communication designers starting concern prototypes [SEP]
[CLS] design research semester topic natural user interface [SEP] now you'll be asking yourself why all these designers are starting to concern themselves with such natural, archaic prototypes of communication, interaction, etc. [SEP] intuitive natural user friendly devices increasingly hold things supposed humans [SEP]
[CLS] interaction natural archaic communication designers starting concern prototypes [SEP] and now i'll hold up one of these little devices, because things are supposed to become increasingly intuitive, increasingly natural, more user friendly, and then you have to look at what we humans consider natural, what we consider user friendly or intuitive. [SEP] humans computers background design tools assistant area natural user interface [SEP]
[CLS] intuitive natural user friendly devices increasingly hold things supposed humans [SEP] and against that background, within the area of natural user interface design, so the next generation of the interaction between humans and computers in the i mean in the relationship between humans and computers, i looked into how our tools, or how the computer has successively transformed itself from a calculator to a digital assistant. [SEP] intuitive looked things natural [SEP]
[CLS] humans computers background design tools assistant area natural user interface [SEP] so i looked into when things are natural and intuitive. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] intuitive looked things natural [SEP] perhaps we should take another look at this. [SEP] place happen [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] why does this happen in the first place? [SEP] social society summarised generation form development briefly moving fourth [SEP]
[CLS] place happen [SEP] so if we look at the development of our society, summarised briefly here, we are moving from the third to the fourth social generation, or social form. [SEP] society modern computer [SEP]
[CLS] social society summarised generation form development briefly moving fourth [SEP] from the modern to the computer society. [SEP] medium society characterised primary [SEP]
[CLS] society modern computer [SEP] each society is characterised by one primary medium. [SEP] society characterised language beginning tribal [SEP]
[CLS] medium society characterised primary [SEP] in the beginning there was the tribal society, characterised by language. [SEP] language move build society people related spoke communicate cave place [SEP]
[CLS] society characterised language beginning tribal [SEP] that means people related to each other because they spoke the same language, they were able to communicate with each other, move into the same cave or another place together, build cities and villages and basically created this tribal society. [SEP] language natural lively primary medium [SEP]
[CLS] language move build society people related spoke communicate cave place [SEP] but the primary medium was language, something very natural, and very lively. [SEP] talk learn naturally small child successively [SEP]
[CLS] language natural lively primary medium [SEP] it was something you had to learn, as no small child can naturally talk, but we learn it successively and relatively naturally. [SEP] abstraction replaced classical age type [SEP]
[CLS] talk learn naturally small child successively [SEP] that was then replaced by the classical age and the first type of abstraction. [SEP] started time writing meaning massive outcry lively language manifest fluid [SEP]
[CLS] abstraction replaced classical age type [SEP] that was a massive outcry at the time, because of course it was when the lively language started to manifest itself in writing, meaning that i took something fluid and alive and started to carve it in stone and so manipulate it. [SEP] depending carve form speak kind coverage compared expresses lively [SEP]
[CLS] started time writing meaning massive outcry lively language manifest fluid [SEP] depending on how and when i carve, a very different kind of coverage comes into being compared to when someone expresses it in a lively form, so to speak. [SEP] medium foothold gradually written form primary gained [SEP]
[CLS] depending carve form speak kind coverage compared expresses lively [SEP] but gradually the written form became the primary medium, and gained a foothold. [SEP] generation primarily [SEP]
[CLS] medium foothold gradually written form primary gained [SEP] then the next generation came, which is where we're still primarily at. [SEP] medium print gutenberg [SEP]
[CLS] generation primarily [SEP] that's the medium of print with gutenberg and others. [SEP] time gentry clergymen mad read affront people start totally fatal [SEP]
[CLS] medium print gutenberg [SEP] that was also an affront at the time, where the gentry, clergymen and others said: have you gone mad, if the people start to read, they'll want to have something to say and that would be totally fatal of course. [SEP] generation moment exciting thing transition hundred years phenomenal phase fact [SEP]
[CLS] time gentry clergymen mad read affront people start totally fatal [SEP] and now we're going into the next generation and the exciting thing about it is that a transition into a new generation only happens every few hundred years and so we're really in this in this phenomenal phase at the moment, the fact that we're experiencing it. [SEP] media socil facebook totally confuses hand social [SEP]
[CLS] generation moment exciting thing transition hundred years phenomenal phase fact [SEP] of course it totally confuses us, because on the one hand we're seeing this new media, socil social media, facebook etc. [SEP] kind thinking transparency phenomena complete clashes horse meat lasagne beef [SEP]
[CLS] media socil facebook totally confuses hand social [SEP] with its complete transparency, which is the new kind of thinking that clashes with the old kind of thinking: don't say that there's now horse meat in the lasagne and not beef or other phenomena, because i want to cover that up and not confess to it. [SEP] worlds thinking moment clashing [SEP]
[CLS] kind thinking transparency phenomena complete clashes horse meat lasagne beef [SEP] and these two worlds, the old and the new ways of thinking, are clashing with each other at the moment. [SEP] society mechanisms principles exciting thing computer archaic patterns thought tribal [SEP]
[CLS] worlds thinking moment clashing [SEP] the exciting thing about this is that when you look at it, this new society, this computer society, you can see that many mechanisms, principles and archaic patterns of thought have been taken from from the tribal society. [SEP] level local global [SEP]
[CLS] society mechanisms principles exciting thing computer archaic patterns thought tribal [SEP] but now it's not on the local level, but on the global level. [SEP] global understood weather [SEP]
[CLS] level local global [SEP] we've understood that weather is global. [SEP] theme ecology global [SEP]
[CLS] global understood weather [SEP] that the theme of ecology is a global theme. [SEP] environmentally aware work local level neighbour thing longer [SEP]
[CLS] theme ecology global [SEP] not, if i am environmentally aware here on the local level and the neighbour is less environmentally aware, the whole thing will no longer work. [SEP] village principles transparency local turned global natural intuitive complete [SEP]
[CLS] environmentally aware work local level neighbour thing longer [SEP] that means the local village has turned into a global village with the same principles: as natural as possible, as intuitive as possible, but also with complete transparency. [SEP] level people village affair happening extension mobile end devices global [SEP]
[CLS] village principles transparency local turned global natural intuitive complete [SEP] just like when people in the village used to know who is having an affair with whom and when, now it's happening with the extension of ourselves through mobile end devices on a global level. [SEP] accumulating knowledge global level increasingly quicker [SEP]
[CLS] level people village affair happening extension mobile end devices global [SEP] we're accumulating our knowledge on a global level and we're accumulating it increasingly quicker and better, for example. [SEP] village happen [SEP]
[CLS] accumulating knowledge global level increasingly quicker [SEP] just like it used to happen in the village. [SEP] forgotten make background looked natural instinctive difference [SEP]
[CLS] village happen [SEP] against that background i looked into what this means, what is still natural to us, what have we perhaps forgotten, and what is instinctive for us, so what difference does it make? [SEP] friendly people make user [SEP]
[CLS] forgotten make background looked natural instinctive difference [SEP] because people often come and ask, can't you make it more user friendly, so that anybody can use it? [SEP] examine change improved [SEP]
[CLS] friendly people make user [SEP] so you have to examine what that means, and not only change it so that it's different, because it needs to be improved too. [SEP] intuitive things designer friendly influence design user fun easy [SEP]
[CLS] examine change improved [SEP] and to see when something is intuitive of course and how i, as a designer, can have influence on this and design things in such a way that they are a user friendly, so as intuitive as possible, because then the things are fun and easy to use. [SEP] studying psychology deal topic perception perceptual [SEP]
[CLS] intuitive things designer friendly influence design user fun easy [SEP] so even while studying, you deal with the topic of perception and perceptual psychology. [SEP] start [SEP]
[CLS] studying psychology deal topic perception perceptual [SEP] and of course that's something where you start and look and say, okay, let me look into the inner self. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] start [SEP] and how does it look in there? [SEP] function [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] and how do we function, when we look in there? [SEP] work intuitive channels perception cognitive processing [SEP]
[CLS] function [SEP] and what does intuitive mean and how do our channels of perception work and how does cognitive processing work? [SEP] works steve jobs dig deeper understand [SEP]
[CLS] work intuitive channels perception cognitive processing [SEP] like steve jobs once said: you need to dig deeper to understand how it works. [SEP] detail manageable fundamentally make user friendly intuitively [SEP]
[CLS] works steve jobs dig deeper understand [SEP] so you really have to go into detail, if you want to make something user friendly or intuitively manageable, and what does that mean fundamentally. [SEP] people senses today officially recognised future eighth added extension sense [SEP]
[CLS] detail manageable fundamentally make user friendly intuitively [SEP] and there you see that, that people a our seven senses, most people think we only have five, but today there are seven officially recognised senses, and in the near future the next, the eighth sense will probably be added to it and as an extension of ourselves again. [SEP] information process absorb [SEP]
[CLS] people senses today officially recognised future eighth added extension sense [SEP] and to see how we process information, how do we absorb information? [SEP] information [SEP]
[CLS] information process absorb [SEP] and just to say, what is information? [SEP] information difference makes [SEP]
[CLS] information [SEP] information is every difference that makes a difference. [SEP] detail people word [SEP]
[CLS] information difference makes [SEP] many people use the word but don't know what it means in detail. [SEP] information understanding turn knowledge fundamental essentially understand data make things [SEP]
[CLS] detail people word [SEP] but i have to have a fundamental understanding, to essentially understand when information becomes information, when data becomes information and when, in turn, information becomes knowledge, so that i know how to later make things as intuitive or naturally manageable as possible. [SEP] perception design affects [SEP]
[CLS] information understanding turn knowledge fundamental essentially understand data make things [SEP] and of course how design affects perception. [SEP] things design pepper intuitively confusing salt basically showing [SEP]
[CLS] perception design affects [SEP] we can see that here, when i design things, then i can design them in a confusing way, as you can see here on the right, where i can't tell which one is salt and which one is pepper, or i can basically design them intuitively, by showing things. [SEP] naturally container pepper lot directly salt [SEP]
[CLS] things design pepper intuitively confusing salt basically showing [SEP] so a lot more naturally, and though they're in a container, i can directly see which one contains salt and which one contains pepper. [SEP] pass pepper salt [SEP]
[CLS] naturally container pepper lot directly salt [SEP] and if i say to someone, pass me the salt or the pepper, they'd have to first think about what's in what with the right one. [SEP] salt sugar left intuitively grab pass [SEP]
[CLS] pass pepper salt [SEP] with the left they'd just intuitively grab it and then pass me the salt, as it hopefully won't be sugar. [SEP] perception deceives [SEP]
[CLS] salt sugar left intuitively grab pass [SEP] but our perception, how it deceives us too. [SEP] context perception [SEP]
[CLS] perception deceives [SEP] for example perception in this context. [SEP] big depending circle bigger small equally perception context place things [SEP]
[CLS] context perception [SEP] the right circle looks bigger than the small one, even though it isn't at all, they're actually equally big, and yet our perception changes, depending on the context we place things in. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] big depending circle bigger small equally perception context place things [SEP] does anybody know what this is? [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] come on. [SEP] pattern work recognition [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] pattern recognition should also work. [SEP] glasses turn [SEP]
[CLS] pattern work recognition [SEP] here here it's more likely to turn into my glasses. [SEP] circle [SEP]
[CLS] glasses turn [SEP] so it's a circle. [SEP] similarity circle starting correlate associate [SEP]
[CLS] circle [SEP] a second circle is starting to correlate or associate a certain similarity. [SEP] unit circle longer parts place half oval suddenly [SEP]
[CLS] similarity circle starting correlate associate [SEP] and if i then place a half oval next to it, we suddenly no longer just see a unit, which is the circle, the circle and, yes, we see a unit, and no longer three parts, one circle, one circle, another. [SEP] psychology perception called law design gestalt turn affects [SEP]
[CLS] unit circle longer parts place half oval suddenly [SEP] this is called a law of design or gestalt psychology, which in turn affects our perception. [SEP] important term design designers great laws [SEP]
[CLS] psychology perception called law design gestalt turn affects [SEP] for the designers it is important, they usually have it in the first term, those great laws of design. [SEP] law proximity continuity [SEP]
[CLS] important term design designers great laws [SEP] the law of proximity, the law of of continuity, etc. [SEP] term forgotten [SEP]
[CLS] law proximity continuity [SEP] they are usually forgotten by the third term. [SEP] component essential design things intuitively [SEP]
[CLS] term forgotten [SEP] but it's an essential component, if you want to design things as intuitively as possible. [SEP] sight phenomenon interesting [SEP]
[CLS] component essential design things intuitively [SEP] the next phenomenon that is also very interesting is sight. [SEP] exciting sound mundane closer [SEP]
[CLS] sight phenomenon interesting [SEP] that might sound mundane at first, but it's exciting, once you take a closer look at it. [SEP] back front eyes [SEP]
[CLS] exciting sound mundane closer [SEP] so we have our eyes at the front and now you think we see from front to back. [SEP] wrong [SEP]
[CLS] back front eyes [SEP] that's wrong. [SEP] front back [SEP]
[CLS] wrong [SEP] first you see from back to front. [SEP] front circle project assumption recognise [SEP]
[CLS] front back [SEP] because you project an assumption that you're seeing something you recognise to the front, such as a circle. [SEP] machine project bring back [SEP]
[CLS] front circle project assumption recognise [SEP] that means we first project what we see before we actually see it, then we bring that to the back into our seeing machine, and then we say, okay, [SEP] feedback cognitive projected [SEP]
[CLS] machine project bring back [SEP] i have this cognitive feedback, you projected something you want to see. [SEP] back [SEP]
[CLS] feedback cognitive projected [SEP] and that's what's there, and comes back again. [SEP] front back trust make [SEP]
[CLS] back [SEP] then it goes back to the front, because the back doesn't trust the front and says, now take another look and make sure that what you see is also what you want to see. [SEP] back [SEP]
[CLS] front back trust make [SEP] and then it goes back to the back and it's not until then that whatever it is is actually seen. [SEP] process happen things exciting sequence span milliseconds [SEP]
[CLS] back [SEP] so it's a very, very exciting process, how the sequence of certain things is and the span of milliseconds in which these things happen. [SEP] image [SEP]
[CLS] process happen things exciting sequence span milliseconds [SEP] i don't know if any of you know this image. [SEP] happening thing [SEP]
[CLS] image [SEP] the same thing that i just described is now happening. [SEP] pattern recognise [SEP]
[CLS] happening thing [SEP] everybody is now trying to recognise something in this pattern. [SEP] recognises [SEP]
[CLS] pattern recognise [SEP] i don't know who recognises what. [SEP] specific [SEP]
[CLS] recognises [SEP] does anyone see anything specific? [SEP] dalmatian [SEP]
[CLS] specific [SEP] a dalmatian, exactly. [SEP] dalmatian [SEP]
[CLS] dalmatian [SEP] once you've seen that that that you can see a dalmatian in this, you know it. [SEP] forget showing dalmatian [SEP]
[CLS] dalmatian [SEP] you'll never forget it again, because i'm showing where the dalmatian is. [SEP] dalmatian [SEP]
[CLS] forget showing dalmatian [SEP] now you see the dalmatian. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] dalmatian [SEP] and, what's more, you'll now always see it. [SEP] time image corrupted effect longer patterns conditioned short dog obscure [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] that means i've corrupted you to the effect that you no longer see patterns in it, and i've conditioned you, within a very short time, to keep seeing this dog in this obscure image. [SEP] feedback projection [SEP]
[CLS] time image corrupted effect longer patterns conditioned short dog obscure [SEP] and that's the projection of seeing, feedback, seeing. [SEP] front project fact dalmatian [SEP]
[CLS] feedback projection [SEP] now i know it and project the fact that i'm seeing a dalmatian to the front. [SEP] dalmatian [SEP]
[CLS] front project fact dalmatian [SEP] then i see the dalmatian. [SEP] area processes exciting place grey rose-tinted [SEP]
[CLS] dalmatian [SEP] so these are really exciting processes, which take place accordingly in this, well, it's not really a grey area, but in this rose-tinted area. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] area processes exciting place grey rose-tinted [SEP] does anyone know what three seconds are? [SEP] time long [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] a long time, yes. [SEP] present [SEP]
[CLS] time long [SEP] that's our present. [SEP] designer interesting [SEP]
[CLS] present [SEP] so it's always interesting to know as a designer. [SEP] speak times slide present past capable bridging waiting occupied [SEP]
[CLS] designer interesting [SEP] if i know something takes three seconds, until i slide from the present into the past so to speak, then i am well capable of bridging waiting times, in that he in that i keep someone occupied for three seconds. [SEP] present process [SEP]
[CLS] speak times slide present past capable bridging waiting occupied [SEP] he will have to process that as the present. [SEP] phenomenon turn past bridge waiting times computer elegant [SEP]
[CLS] present process [SEP] then it will turn into the past and, in that way, i can bridge waiting times at the computer for example in a very elegant way, if i know this phenomenon. [SEP] milliseconds twenty-five [SEP]
[CLS] phenomenon turn past bridge waiting times computer elegant [SEP] what takes twenty-five milliseconds? [SEP] milliseconds [SEP]
[CLS] milliseconds twenty-five [SEP] yes, milliseconds. [SEP] phenomenon exciting [SEP]
[CLS] milliseconds [SEP] another very exciting phenomenon. [SEP] time fall love [SEP]
[CLS] phenomenon exciting [SEP] it's the time it takes to fall in love with someone. [SEP] pay happen attention long held responsible [SEP]
[CLS] time fall love [SEP] that means, attention, now you know that, pay attention to how long you look at someone, because i will not be held responsible for what might happen. [SEP] milliseconds phenomenon sixteen exciting [SEP]
[CLS] pay happen attention long held responsible [SEP] and sixteen milliseconds, also a very exciting phenomenon. [SEP] period time form perceptions [SEP]
[CLS] milliseconds phenomenon sixteen exciting [SEP] that's the period of time it takes to form most perceptions we have. [SEP] speed things impression extremely high perceive [SEP]
[CLS] period time form perceptions [SEP] that means the first impression comes to us at an extremely high speed, the way we perceive things. [SEP] things speak pay attention guard environment [SEP]
[CLS] speed things impression extremely high perceive [SEP] and the way we see things, what we pay attention to and how we guard ourselves against our environment so to speak, so that we can consider it accordingly. [SEP] topic ergonomics designers perceptions neural processes cognitive primarily relationship man [SEP]
[CLS] things speak pay attention guard environment [SEP] of course designers don't only look at the topic of perceptions and neural processes or cognitive ergonomics, but primarily at the topic of the relationship between man and object of course. [SEP] objects humans deal [SEP]
[CLS] topic ergonomics designers perceptions neural processes cognitive primarily relationship man [SEP] so how do humans deal with certain objects. [SEP] language formal aspects hand practical functions terms product aesthetic [SEP]
[CLS] objects humans deal [SEP] on the one hand there are the practical functions in terms of product language, so formal aspects or formal aesthetic aspects. [SEP] functions indicator [SEP]
[CLS] language formal aspects hand practical functions terms product aesthetic [SEP] there are indicator functions, where i know exactly where i have to look. [SEP] functions practical symbolic spend horrendous sums money bag fit [SEP]
[CLS] functions indicator [SEP] but there are also symbolic functions; why does someone spend such horrendous sums of money on such a little bag that you can hardly fit anything into, even when it's not very practical? [SEP] symbolic semantic level designers preoccupied [SEP]
[CLS] functions practical symbolic spend horrendous sums money bag fit [SEP] we're more on the symbolic, on the semantic level there, something we designers are also preoccupied with. [SEP] topic back actual natural user interface usability [SEP]
[CLS] symbolic semantic level designers preoccupied [SEP] going back to my actual topic natural user interface and the topic that's behind that is usability of course. [SEP] reach goal user usability effective efficient context satisfying [SEP]
[CLS] topic back actual natural user interface usability [SEP] usability always means how can i reach a goal as soon as possible or how can a user reach a goal in a certain user context in an as effective, efficient and satisfying way possible. [SEP] norm [SEP]
[CLS] reach goal user usability effective efficient context satisfying [SEP] that's what the norm says. [SEP] make user friendly [SEP]
[CLS] norm [SEP] how can i make something as user friendly as possible? [SEP] training handle directly manual correspondent [SEP]
[CLS] make user friendly [SEP] can i handle it directly or do i need a manual or a correspondent training. [SEP] friendly usable user [SEP]
[CLS] training handle directly manual correspondent [SEP] and then it's less usable or user friendly. [SEP] making differently prettier easier [SEP]
[CLS] friendly usable user [SEP] making it differently or prettier doesn't mean it's easier to use. [SEP] understand [SEP]
[CLS] making differently prettier easier [SEP] that's something we have to understand. [SEP] software terms usable including iphone intuitive understand ninety-nine percent today [SEP]
[CLS] understand [SEP] and if you look at some of the software in those terms, then you'll understand why ninety-nine percent of today's software is less intuitive or not instantaneously usable, including the ipad in many areas or the iphone, although it's already a lot more intuitive than classical software. [SEP] factor elementary intuitive scene people usability start economic success apple [SEP]
[CLS] software terms usable including iphone intuitive understand ninety-nine percent today [SEP] intuitive usability didn't start to become an elementary economic factor, an elementary success factor, when apple appeared on the scene, if i wanted to make technological devices usable for people. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] factor elementary intuitive scene people usability start economic success apple [SEP] why? [SEP] rule average usability interfaces reach goal times faster type natural [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] because, as a rule, we can reach our goal five times faster on average, for example, through this new type of usability, so natural user interfaces. [SEP] software imagine classical thing type natural hours hour [SEP]
[CLS] rule average usability interfaces reach goal times faster type natural [SEP] you need to imagine that in the following way, if you do something with classical software and take five hours to do it, then you'd only need one hour to do the same thing with this new type of natural software. [SEP] hours earlier home employer [SEP]
[CLS] software imagine classical thing type natural hours hour [SEP] that probably doesn't mean that you can go home four hours earlier, but that your employer or whoever will think of something else you can do with those four hours. [SEP] efficiency things increase manage [SEP]
[CLS] hours earlier home employer [SEP] but what i want to say is that for us it is of course accordingly an increase in efficiency, to manage to do certain things. [SEP] software interfaces abstract systems back area command line months understand [SEP]
[CLS] efficiency things increase manage [SEP] if we go back to the area of software, here you see the first command line interfaces, which were very abstract, and it took months to understand how to handle these systems. [SEP] metaphor model desktop usable worked neural mental software ergonomists conception [SEP]
[CLS] software interfaces abstract systems back area command line months understand [SEP] then came the next ones, which already worked with a neural model or mental model, as software ergonomists say, because you'd have a conception of something, a metaphor, a metaphor of a desktop, to make the computer usable. [SEP] codes metaphor cryptic [SEP]
[CLS] metaphor model desktop usable worked neural mental software ergonomists conception [SEP] so no more zeros and ones with cryptic codes, but a metaphor. [SEP] friendly made thing considerably user lot [SEP]
[CLS] codes metaphor cryptic [SEP] that made the whole thing considerably more user friendly, but of course it could still be a lot better. [SEP] generation graphic user interfaces works behaviour lot [SEP]
[CLS] friendly made thing considerably user lot [SEP] the next generation of graphic user interfaces already works with behaviour a lot more. [SEP] designer appearance design behaviour [SEP]
[CLS] generation graphic user interfaces works behaviour lot [SEP] so, as a designer, i design behaviour much more much more often than appearance. [SEP] shift paradigm [SEP]
[CLS] designer appearance design behaviour [SEP] that's also a paradigm shift. [SEP] success application suddenly appearance increasingly irrelevant usability [SEP]
[CLS] shift paradigm [SEP] that i can suddenly that the appearance is becoming increasingly irrelevant for success, and usability is becoming an application. [SEP] speech interfaces voice touch cursor step natural user control things [SEP]
[CLS] success application suddenly appearance increasingly irrelevant usability [SEP] and if i go a step further in these natural user interfaces, where i can control things via voice, speech, touch and gesture rather than a mouse and cursor, then i am even faster and more immediate. [SEP] intuitive question point things [SEP]
[CLS] speech interfaces voice touch cursor step natural user control things [SEP] but that also takes me to the question as to at what point things become more intuitive? [SEP] ergonomics intuitive rough-handle friend point view cognitive [SEP]
[CLS] intuitive question point things [SEP] if they become more intuitive and then i have to rough-handle my little friend here again and see what that means from the point of view of cognitive ergonomics, when is something really intuitive? [SEP] humans intuitive [SEP]
[CLS] ergonomics intuitive rough-handle friend point view cognitive [SEP] and that's for us humans, something is intuitive when there's an as little as possible a need to think about it. [SEP] apparently humans make things simple [SEP]
[CLS] humans intuitive [SEP] so apparently humans don't like to think very much, they want to make things relatively simple for themselves. [SEP] speak intuitive [SEP]
[CLS] apparently humans make things simple [SEP] the less i think about something so to speak, the more intuitive it is. [SEP] designer [SEP]
[CLS] speak intuitive [SEP] and what does that mean to a designer? [SEP] metaphor designer transfer existing performance models make [SEP]
[CLS] designer [SEP] it means that when we can see that we can transfer existing performance models onto something else, for example the metaphor, then i can make use of that as a designer. [SEP] intuitive human friendly software transfer performance model make considerably user [SEP]
[CLS] metaphor designer transfer existing performance models make [SEP] that means i can transfer an intuitive, human performance model onto a software and can so make the software considerably more user friendly. [SEP] poses question intuitive performance scheme humans [SEP]
[CLS] intuitive human friendly software transfer performance model make considerably user [SEP] that poses the question as to what is actually the most intuitive performance scheme that we humans have and now i've already given it away. [SEP] model so-called osit [SEP]
[CLS] poses question intuitive performance scheme humans [SEP] it's the so-called osit model. [SEP] select inform transact orient osit acronym stands [SEP]
[CLS] model so-called osit [SEP] we all use it, and osit is an acronym that stands for orient, select, inform, transact. [SEP] time pretty part unconsciously intuitively instinctively [SEP]
[CLS] select inform transact orient osit acronym stands [SEP] every one of you is doing this the whole time, but you're doing it unconsciously and, well, pretty intuitively and also instinctively in part. [SEP] model intercultural time present shape mother womb functions worldwide young [SEP]
[CLS] time pretty part unconsciously intuitively instinctively [SEP] the model already takes shape while you're still in your mother's womb and it's intercultural, so it functions worldwide among young and old, and is used by us the whole time, without most people knowing that this model is present. [SEP] osit activity day fifty seventy thousand times depending ascertained sleep [SEP]
[CLS] model intercultural time present shape mother womb functions worldwide young [SEP] osit in itself is used by us fifty to seventy thousand times depending on the activity, it was ascertained that when you sleep it is strained less than in the day. [SEP] select inform orient transact system transfer performance model interaction [SEP]
[CLS] osit activity day fifty seventy thousand times depending ascertained sleep [SEP] i can transfer this performance model orient, select, inform, transact to an interaction system. [SEP] metaphor action transferal desktop object kind longer physical pattern principle [SEP]
[CLS] select inform orient transact system transfer performance model interaction [SEP] and this kind of transferal, much like the metaphor of the desktop, but no longer a metaphor of a physical object, but a metaphor of a pattern of action, a principle of action. [SEP] metaphor desktop higher grail user friendliness transferal classic [SEP]
[CLS] metaphor action transferal desktop object kind longer physical pattern principle [SEP] and that's on a higher grail of user friendliness than the transferal of a classic metaphor, which is the one of the desktop. [SEP] overview select selection inform detail transact shopping transfer orient shape [SEP]
[CLS] metaphor desktop higher grail user friendliness transferal classic [SEP] and if i now transfer this, if i let orient take shape as an overview, select as a selection, inform in the case that it comes up close to me, and i can look at in detail, and yes, transact means i can put it somewhere or send someone or do the shopping, etc., [SEP] thing transfer [SEP]
[CLS] overview select selection inform detail transact shopping transfer orient shape [SEP] and then i can transfer the whole thing. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] thing transfer [SEP] i'll try to do that using an example. [SEP] earlier cake [SEP]

[CLS] overview chocolate entire filter show things [SEP] and suddenly i have an interface that is considerably more intuitive and natural. [SEP] things pieces speak fact grab hold touch considerably natural make [SEP]
[CLS] natural suddenly interface considerably intuitive [SEP] because the fact that i can grab hold of things like these little pieces, that i can touch them and they come to me, is considerably more natural than when i am able to make these things accessible via hierarchically organised websites or other mechanisms so to speak. [SEP] imagination knowledge solutions important close sentence give advice designers differently [SEP]
[CLS] things pieces speak fact grab hold touch considerably natural make [SEP] imagination is more important than knowledge, and i'd like to close on that sentence a and again give the advice that designers must also think differently to arrive at new solutions, and so i thank you warmly for your attention and please. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] i'd like to reintroduce you to a particular aspect of curiosity. [SEP] firstly child baby contents awakened growing thing interested sort excretions [SEP]
[CLS] curiosity reintroduce aspect [SEP] firstly, when you are growing up as a child, as a baby, the thing you are interested in is which what sort of excretions you have, right? and depending on whether your parents have allowed you to more or less play with your potty and stir its contents, your curiosity is of course awakened. [SEP] learned curiosity [SEP]
[CLS] firstly child baby contents awakened growing thing interested sort excretions [SEP] and curiosity can't be learned. [SEP] people learned characteristic [SEP]
[CLS] learned curiosity [SEP] that's why all the people who are here are actually people who have a characteristic that can't be learned. [SEP] environment world forty quality objective transform entire discussion end years [SEP]
[CLS] people learned characteristic [SEP] my objective is to transform this entire discussion about the environment, the end of the world, forty years of the-club-of-rome, into quality. [SEP] central point [SEP]
[CLS] environment world forty quality objective transform entire discussion end years [SEP] and there's one central point here. [SEP] phosphorus [SEP]
[CLS] central point [SEP] and that has to do with phosphorus. [SEP] give chance pee [SEP]
[CLS] phosphorus [SEP] give pee a chance. [SEP] day grams release phosphorus region absorb [SEP]
[CLS] give chance pee [SEP] every day you release + you release in the region of two grams of phosphorus and every day you have to absorb two grams of phosphorus. [SEP] teeth [SEP]
[CLS] day grams release phosphorus region absorb [SEP] otherwise you couldn't have teeth. [SEP] energy save [SEP]
[CLS] teeth [SEP] and you wouldn't be able to save energy. [SEP] bones [SEP]
[CLS] energy save [SEP] you wouldn't be able to have bones. [SEP] molluscs float earth seas amorphous [SEP]
[CLS] bones [SEP] we'd only be able to float in the earth's seas as amorphous molluscs. [SEP] fact phosphorus absorb release [SEP]
[CLS] molluscs float earth seas amorphous [SEP] if, in fact, we couldn't absorb and release phosphorus. [SEP] incredibly dealing matter [SEP]
[CLS] fact phosphorus absorb release [SEP] incredibly enough, we we are dealing with something here that would be a matter of course, but isn't at all. [SEP] talking energy problem phosphorus [SEP]
[CLS] incredibly dealing matter [SEP] because everybody's talking about energy, but nobody's talking about the phosphorus problem. [SEP] critical phosphorus problem [SEP]
[CLS] talking energy problem phosphorus [SEP] the phosphorus problem is much more critical. [SEP] countries dependent [SEP]
[CLS] critical phosphorus problem [SEP] we are dependent on two countries. [SEP] plants phosphorus years mining worldwide emitting lot uranium environment amount [SEP]
[CLS] countries dependent [SEP] we only have phosphorus for two years and phosphorus mining worldwide is already emitting a lot more uranium into the environment than the amount that is used in all nuclear plants. [SEP] fifteen germany twenty years thousand tonnes uranium put fields [SEP]
[CLS] plants phosphorus years mining worldwide emitting lot uranium environment amount [SEP] in the last twenty years alone, fifteen thousand tonnes of uranium was put onto our fields in germany. [SEP] absorb [SEP]
[CLS] fifteen germany twenty years thousand tonnes uranium put fields [SEP] and we absorb all of it. [SEP] children leukemia [SEP]
[CLS] absorb [SEP] it causes leukemia in children. [SEP] damage protecting environment [SEP]
[CLS] children leukemia [SEP] and we think we're protecting the environment when we do a little less damage. [SEP] protect environment drive car [SEP]
[CLS] damage protecting environment [SEP] so, for example, protect the environment, drive the car less. [SEP] protect environment produce rubbish [SEP]
[CLS] protect environment drive car [SEP] protect the environment, produce less rubbish. [SEP] protect environment consume energy [SEP]
[CLS] protect environment produce rubbish [SEP] protect the environment, consume less energy. [SEP] protection [SEP]
[CLS] protect environment consume energy [SEP] but that's not protection. [SEP] protect child hit times [SEP]
[CLS] protection [SEP] that's like saying, protect your child, hit it three times instead of five. [SEP] destruction [SEP]
[CLS] protect child hit times [SEP] it's just a little less destruction. [SEP] grave thinking cradle entire planet cemetery sooner [SEP]
[CLS] destruction [SEP] if that's our thinking from from the cradle to the grave, then our our entire planet will become a cemetery sooner or later. [SEP] cradle [SEP]
[CLS] grave thinking cradle entire planet cemetery sooner [SEP] that's why we need to think from cradle to cradle. [SEP] important thing soil [SEP]
[CLS] cradle [SEP] and the most important thing is to look at is the soil first of all. [SEP] carbon ground stores sixty percent planet [SEP]
[CLS] important thing soil [SEP] the ground stores over sixty percent of the planet's carbon. [SEP] hectare metre thirty moment growing corn losing eleven kilograms tonnes [SEP]
[CLS] carbon ground stores sixty percent planet [SEP] at the moment we're growing corn and losing between eleven and thirty kilograms thirty tonnes per hectare, if you were to calculate it per square metre. [SEP] soil losing five-thousand times formed [SEP]
[CLS] hectare metre thirty moment growing corn losing eleven kilograms tonnes [SEP] that means we're losing five-thousand times more than what is formed in the soil. [SEP] issue waste [SEP]
[CLS] soil losing five-thousand times formed [SEP] of course we can look at the issue of waste first of all. [SEP] contents packaging [SEP]
[CLS] issue waste [SEP] and everything is either the packaging or the contents. [SEP] offenbach twenty nappies percent amount waste produced households consists [SEP]
[CLS] contents packaging [SEP] in offenbach, for example, twenty percent of the amount of waste produced by households consists of nappies. [SEP] older bigger nappies [SEP]
[CLS] offenbach twenty nappies percent amount waste produced households consists [SEP] and as we get older, the nappies get bigger. [SEP] stage speak pre-nappy [SEP]
[CLS] older bigger nappies [SEP] + that is they're all in the pre-nappy stage, so to speak. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] stage speak pre-nappy [SEP] right? [SEP] nappies baby six-thousand [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] one a baby needs about six-thousand nappies. [SEP] make reduce ten percent difference [SEP]
[CLS] nappies baby six-thousand [SEP] we can reduce that by ten percent of course, but what difference would that make? [SEP] china make [SEP]
[CLS] make reduce ten percent difference [SEP] china can make up for that in one second. [SEP] insignificant [SEP]
[CLS] china make [SEP] it's entirely insignificant. [SEP] nappies question deal [SEP]
[CLS] insignificant [SEP] so the question is, how should we deal with nappies? [SEP] proof pigs humans [SEP]
[CLS] nappies question deal [SEP] here we have a the proof, by the way, that humans are not pigs. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] proof pigs humans [SEP] i'd like to tell you why. [SEP] pigs phosphorus faeces released solid components [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] because with pigs, phosphorus is released in their solid components faeces. [SEP] people urine released [SEP]
[CLS] pigs phosphorus faeces released solid components [SEP] with people, it is released in the urine. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] people urine released [SEP] yes. [SEP] pigs humans [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] so humans can't be pigs. [SEP] proves [SEP]
[CLS] pigs humans [SEP] that proves it, doesn't it? [SEP] traditionally environment planet discussion belief [SEP]
[CLS] proves [SEP] traditionally, in the discussion about the environment, there is the belief that there are too many of us on this planet. [SEP] deny people existence hostile grabby [SEP]
[CLS] traditionally environment planet discussion belief [SEP] and if you deny people the if you deny people their existence, if you say, it would be better if you weren't here at all, people become grabby and hostile. [SEP] gore heroes population great important stabilising human [SEP]
[CLS] deny people existence hostile grabby [SEP] and so you have someone like al gore, one of our great heroes, saying: there is nothing more important than stabilising the human population. [SEP] life world israel people save human saving [SEP]
[CLS] gore heroes population great important stabilising human [SEP] in israel people say, if you save a human life, you're saving the world. [SEP] end people [SEP]
[CLS] life world israel people save human saving [SEP] on our end we say, the more people you get out of the way, the better. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] end people [SEP] yes. [SEP] question [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] the first question is, are there really too many of us? [SEP] ants planet people weight weigh times [SEP]
[CLS] question [SEP] if you look at ants, the weight of ants on the planet, then ants weigh four times as much a people. [SEP] termites vegetarians mention usa [SEP]
[CLS] ants planet people weight weigh times [SEP] i could also mention termites, but in the usa nobody likes termites, although they're vegetarians. [SEP] ants weigh [SEP]
[CLS] termites vegetarians mention usa [SEP] so ants weigh more than we do. [SEP] months weight people work harder physically live energy consumption amounts [SEP]
[CLS] ants weigh [SEP] and because they work so much harder physically than we do and only live for three to six months, their weight, their energy consumption amounts to that of thirty billion people. [SEP] stupid [SEP]
[CLS] months weight people work harder physically live energy consumption amounts [SEP] that means there are not too many of us, we're just too stupid, you see? [SEP] achieve place offenbach forty removed wanted sad planet understand program [SEP]
[CLS] stupid [SEP] and when you see how far removed we are from what we wanted to and could achieve, and how sad we are to be on this planet in the first place, you can understand why offenbach, for example, has a program to be climate neutral by twenty forty, right? [SEP] exist climate neutral [SEP]
[CLS] achieve place offenbach forty removed wanted sad planet understand program [SEP] you can only be climate neutral if you don't exist, you see? [SEP] chance [SEP]
[CLS] exist climate neutral [SEP] that's your only chance. [SEP] tree climate neutral [SEP]
[CLS] chance [SEP] have you ever seen a climate neutral tree? [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] tree climate neutral [SEP] have you? [SEP] single [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] just one single one? [SEP] trees entire intelligence amounts wanting stupid [SEP]
[CLS] single [SEP] that means our entire intelligence amounts to us wanting to be more stupid than trees, you see? [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] trees entire intelligence amounts wanting stupid [SEP] you see? [SEP] neutral single tree carbon [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] there is not one single tree that is carbon neutral. [SEP] thankfully [SEP]
[CLS] neutral single tree carbon [SEP] thankfully, right? [SEP] trees problem overpopulation [SEP]
[CLS] thankfully [SEP] there's no problem with overpopulation among trees. [SEP] hundred billion trees amazon forest [SEP]
[CLS] trees problem overpopulation [SEP] there are still six hundred billion trees in the amazon forest alone. [SEP] trees heard overpopulation [SEP]
[CLS] hundred billion trees amazon forest [SEP] of those have you ever heard of overpopulation of trees? [SEP] trees intelligence amounts wanting dumber [SEP]
[CLS] trees heard overpopulation [SEP] so all of our intelligence amounts to us wanting to be dumber than trees. [SEP] demeter agriculture returned strictest organization organic metabolic waste [SEP]
[CLS] trees intelligence amounts wanting dumber [SEP] and then you see that even something like demeter, the strictest organization for organic yes agriculture, doesn't allow for our own metabolic waste to be returned. [SEP] phosphorus circulated year lose tonnes [SEP]
[CLS] demeter agriculture returned strictest organization organic metabolic waste [SEP] every year we lose about three tonnes of phosphorus, which should really be circulated. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] phosphorus circulated year lose tonnes [SEP] and so there are too many of us. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] just because of that. [SEP] planet agriculture bioland called cycle feel guilty organic permits excrement [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] that means we feel so guilty on this planet, that we say, there is no organic agriculture, no bioland, no nature-et-progrès or whatever they're all called, that permits our own excrement to be put back into the cycle. [SEP] sad [SEP]
[CLS] planet agriculture bioland called cycle feel guilty organic permits excrement [SEP] isn't that sad? [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] sad [SEP] and that means there are too many of us. [SEP] oil makes sense damage [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] it certainly makes sense to cause less damage when it comes to the use of oil. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] oil makes sense damage [SEP] but where are we of use? [SEP] footprint minimize ecological point big [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] we try to minimize our ecological footprint, but the point is to have a big footprint that's of use. [SEP] good society economy environment honourable thing [SEP]
[CLS] footprint minimize ecological point big [SEP] we want to be good for society, we want to be good for the economy, but when it comes to the environment, the most honourable thing for us would be to not be here at all, right? [SEP] emissions [SEP]
[CLS] good society economy environment honourable thing [SEP] zero emissions, you see? [SEP] exist emissions [SEP]
[CLS] emissions [SEP] you can only have zero emissions if you don't exist. [SEP] emissions shoot [SEP]
[CLS] exist emissions [SEP] even if you were to shoot yourself now, you'd still have emissions. [SEP] solve [SEP]
[CLS] emissions shoot [SEP] so you can't solve that. [SEP] differently [SEP]
[CLS] solve [SEP] we can do it differently. [SEP] nutrients win back [SEP]
[CLS] differently [SEP] we can win back our nutrients. [SEP] nutrients agriculture practice brazil win back [SEP]
[CLS] nutrients win back [SEP] with the agriculture we practice in brazil in which we win back nutrients. [SEP] agriculture direct back nutrients [SEP]
[CLS] nutrients agriculture practice brazil win back [SEP] this is a very direct way to get back nutrients in agriculture. [SEP] china directly waste produced [SEP]
[CLS] agriculture direct back nutrients [SEP] we do it in china for example, where we directly take the waste produced from it. [SEP] pot china chamber called honey [SEP]
[CLS] china directly waste produced [SEP] in in china a a chamber pot is still called a honey pot, you could say, right? [SEP] nutrients western world stupid bring back [SEP]
[CLS] pot china chamber called honey [SEP] and in our western world we were always too stupid to bring back our nutrients. [SEP] taking farmers entire history western civilization characterized city giving back [SEP]
[CLS] nutrients western world stupid bring back [SEP] this means that the entire history of western civilization is characterized by the city always just taking, and never giving anything back to the farmers. [SEP] cities growing places farmers moving nutrients increasingly distance [SEP]
[CLS] taking farmers entire history western civilization characterized city giving back [SEP] so the cities had to keep on growing, as the farmers were moving into the cities and the cities had to get their nutrients from increasingly distance places. [SEP] imploded western empires expanding manage infrastructure anymore [SEP]
[CLS] cities growing places farmers moving nutrients increasingly distance [SEP] that's why all western empires just kept on expanding until they couldn't manage the infrastructure anymore and then they imploded. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] imploded western empires expanding manage infrastructure anymore [SEP] you see? [SEP] china [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] it was different in china. [SEP] end nutrients managed civilization thousand years return [SEP]
[CLS] china [SEP] they managed to have a civilization for five thousand years on end, as they were always able to return the nutrients. [SEP] today china people toilet invited dinner expect stay meal [SEP]
[CLS] end nutrients managed civilization thousand years return [SEP] even today, if you get invited to dinner in china, people expect you to stay on after the meal until you need to use the toilet. [SEP] unfriendly nutrients [SEP]
[CLS] today china people toilet invited dinner expect stay meal [SEP] because it's unfriendly to go and take the nutrients with you. [SEP] dinner nutrients invited steal [SEP]
[CLS] unfriendly nutrients [SEP] you were you were invited to dinner, not to steal nutrients. [SEP] internet win back nutrients [SEP]
[CLS] dinner nutrients invited steal [SEP] that means you can see how to win back nutrients on the internet. [SEP] thousand agriculture generate biogas favelas raise fish nice thing practice [SEP]
[CLS] internet win back nutrients [SEP] the nice thing about that is that when you do that, so when you practice agriculture, generate biogas, on one hectare of land with five thousand inhabitants in the favelas, a farmer can earn about one thousand five hundred dollars and maintain the plot with it, raise chickens and pigs and ducks and grow vegetables and farm fish. [SEP] percent great thing crime rate favelas ninety [SEP]
[CLS] thousand agriculture generate biogas favelas raise fish nice thing practice [SEP] and the great thing about it is that the crime rate in the favelas goes down by over ninety percent. [SEP] eye people make evil [SEP]
[CLS] percent great thing crime rate favelas ninety [SEP] so we don't have to keep an eye on the people to make sure they do as little evil as possible. [SEP] good support [SEP]
[CLS] eye people make evil [SEP] we can support them in doing good. [SEP] high-tech agriculture plots care [SEP]
[CLS] good support [SEP] that's high-tech agriculture of course, but the plots take care of themselves. [SEP] water side product clean [SEP]
[CLS] high-tech agriculture plots care [SEP] the side product is clean water. [SEP] easily designed farmer farm [SEP]
[CLS] water side product clean [SEP] and they're designed in such a way that a farmer can farm them easily. [SEP] rate crime [SEP]
[CLS] easily designed farmer farm [SEP] that means the rate of crime goes down. [SEP] plots years sabotaged built hundred fifty twenty [SEP]
[CLS] rate crime [SEP] and none of these plots, and we've built over one hundred fifty of them in the last twenty years, none of these plots was every sabotaged. [SEP] years easy throw litre waste oil plot ruined [SEP]
[CLS] plots years sabotaged built hundred fifty twenty [SEP] it would be easy to just throw a litre of waste oil onto it and the plot would be ruined for years. [SEP] happen [SEP]
[CLS] years easy throw litre waste oil plot ruined [SEP] that doesn't happen. [SEP] eye people evil [SEP]
[CLS] happen [SEP] that means we do not need to keep an eye on people so that they do as little evil as possible. [SEP] good support [SEP]
[CLS] eye people evil [SEP] we can support them in doing good. [SEP] back phosphorus [SEP]
[CLS] good support [SEP] so we must get the phosphorus back. [SEP] active write frankfurt germany suitable purification plant [SEP]
[CLS] back phosphorus [SEP] and by the way, if you want to get active, write this down, in germany the most suitable purification plant is the one in frankfurt. [SEP] offenbach hand give frankfurters [SEP]
[CLS] active write frankfurt germany suitable purification plant [SEP] unfortunately not the one on offenbach, but perhaps you can give the frankfurters a hand. [SEP] phosphorus plant frankfurt winning back [SEP]
[CLS] offenbach hand give frankfurters [SEP] because the plant in frankfurt would be the best at winning back phosphorus. [SEP] back [SEP]
[CLS] phosphorus plant frankfurt winning back [SEP] and it must go back. [SEP] critical phosphorus [SEP]
[CLS] back [SEP] we can see that phosphorus is really critical. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] critical phosphorus [SEP] and we can see that it can be done. [SEP] holland working years [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] in holland we've been working on this for over three years now. [SEP] phosphorus dutch government stated country worldwide win back [SEP]
[CLS] holland working years [SEP] the dutch government has stated that it will be the first country worldwide to win back phosphorus. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] phosphorus dutch government stated country worldwide win back [SEP] but we need this everywhere. [SEP] worldwide countries control seventy percent phosphorus reservoirs [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] you see, there are two countries that control almost seventy percent of the phosphorus reservoirs worldwide. [SEP] opec amateurs bunch [SEP]
[CLS] worldwide countries control seventy percent phosphorus reservoirs [SEP] there's the opec, a a bunch of amateurs. [SEP] deposits consists twenty-six member countries control forty percent oil [SEP]
[CLS] opec amateurs bunch [SEP] it consists of twenty-six member countries that control forty percent of all the oil deposits. [SEP] sources oil replaced energy [SEP]
[CLS] deposits consists twenty-six member countries control forty percent oil [SEP] and oil will be able to be replaced by other energy sources. [SEP] replaced phosphorus [SEP]
[CLS] sources oil replaced energy [SEP] but phosphorus will not be able to be replaced. [SEP] bad point make exists [SEP]
[CLS] replaced phosphorus [SEP] that's why the point is not to to make what already exists a little less bad, but to do something right. [SEP] question [SEP]
[CLS] bad point make exists [SEP] and it's the first question to ask is what is right. [SEP] effectivity efficiency [SEP]
[CLS] question [SEP] so it's about effectivity, not efficiency. [SEP] flowers holland easier understand built country [SEP]
[CLS] effectivity efficiency [SEP] in holland it's easier to understand this, because holland built the country on flowers. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] flowers holland easier understand built country [SEP] you see? [SEP] imagine sad roses wife upset turn fifty [SEP]

[CLS] footprint disadvantageous [SEP] when you go running, right, every footprint destroys the ground. [SEP] soil moss dies wind water wash [SEP]
[CLS] running ground footprint destroys [SEP] because the soil will the moss dies and the the wind and water wash away the soil. [SEP] italy longer footprint water remain field [SEP]
[CLS] soil moss dies wind water wash [SEP] but if you're in italy, every footprint means the water will remain in the field for longer. [SEP] footprint wetland leaving large turn [SEP]
[CLS] italy longer footprint water remain field [SEP] so it's about leaving leaving a large footprint, which will turn into wetland. [SEP] management guilt [SEP]
[CLS] footprint wetland leaving large turn [SEP] not guilt management. [SEP] germany sustainability [SEP]

[CLS] interpreters music translators written notes resounding [SEP] everybody who has anything to do with foreign languages knows that a translator can't just simply render a text in another language word for word, but must also understand the deeper meaning of the words and the context in which they appear, so that a meaningful translation can occur. [SEP] translating knowledge poetry german english demand translation literature [SEP]

[CLS] translating knowledge poetry german english demand translation literature [SEP] what we musicians do with our musical language is very alien to non-professionals. [SEP] interpreter piece music musical notes [SEP]
[CLS] non-professionals musicians musical language alien [SEP] as an interpreter of a piece of music i only have the musical notes at first. [SEP] composer notes writing includes thought [SEP]

[CLS] composer notes writing includes thought [SEP] in reality the notes are very vague and imprecise. [SEP] landscape precise notes imprecise verbal description extremely [SEP]
[CLS] imprecise reality notes vague [SEP] these notes are about as precise or imprecise as the verbal description of a landscape, even if that might seem extremely precise. [SEP] landscape green wind smell flowers verbal description guess shade hear [SEP]
[CLS] landscape precise notes imprecise verbal description extremely [SEP] because you can't smell the flowers in the verbal description of a landscape, you can't guess the shade of green, you can't hear or feel the whispering of the wind. [SEP] concrete audible non-verbal language interpreter translate imprecise indications notes musical [SEP]
[CLS] landscape green wind smell flowers verbal description guess shade hear [SEP] this means that the interpreter must translate these imprecise indications in the language of notes into a different, which is to say an audible, concrete, non-verbal musical language. [SEP] today music interpret translate verbally [SEP]
[CLS] concrete audible non-verbal language interpreter translate imprecise indications notes musical [SEP] today i'd like to verbally translate what i usually translate into music, or interpret. [SEP] translation call [SEP]
[CLS] today music interpret translate verbally [SEP] so you could call it the translation of a translation. [SEP] translation german english prefer translate [SEP]
[CLS] translation call [SEP] that's why i prefer to do it all in german, because if i'd have to translate it into english, that would be like the translation of the translation of the translation. [SEP] music opinion functions lot spoken language [SEP]
[CLS] translation german english prefer translate [SEP] the so, music functions a lot like spoken language in my opinion. [SEP] language annotated notes function letters [SEP]
[CLS] music opinion functions lot spoken language [SEP] the annotated notes have the function of the letters of a language. [SEP] string read notes find keys piano position violin [SEP]
[CLS] language annotated notes function letters [SEP] so it's not enough to just be able to read notes and find the according keys on the piano or the right position on a violin string. [SEP] write letters learned [SEP]
[CLS] string read notes find keys piano position violin [SEP] those would just be the letters you learned to write. [SEP] language recognize sense letters [SEP]

[CLS] period imagine time images reading literature [SEP] after a while, you already have a vast reservoir of knowledge surrounding the composer as an interpreter, and you listen to them regularly, and so it becomes easier and easier to understand and feel with the composer. [SEP] composer increasingly friend living [SEP]

[CLS] level explain mechanism today make accessible familiar unconscious [SEP] the mechanism comes from the lie. [SEP] wall lie heard people intention building [SEP]
[CLS] lie mechanism [SEP] but don't think of a lie you might have heard when people say, nobody has any intention of building a wall. [SEP] blocked start piling stones view [SEP]
[CLS] wall lie heard people intention building [SEP] and then they start piling up stones so your view is blocked. [SEP] lie shows liar [SEP]
[CLS] blocked start piling stones view [SEP] a lie like that shows you that the liar himself doesn't believe what he says. [SEP] mind easily proven [SEP]
[CLS] lie shows liar [SEP] and it's easily proven that he has something entirely different in mind. [SEP] deceiving [SEP]

[CLS] laughing point recognize important lie time experience artists good telling [SEP] because artists have a distorted relationship to the lie. [SEP] woman mirror artist [SEP]
[CLS] lie artists distorted relationship [SEP] the artist tells you something, and especially this woman, that she can't see if she just looks in the mirror. [SEP] artist conveying looked work art [SEP]
[CLS] woman mirror artist [SEP] the artist is conveying something you can only get to know once you've looked at the work of art again and again. [SEP] unpleasant feeling start [SEP]

[CLS] lie live lives [SEP] because we want this self-deception, this feeling of being brilliant, descended from the highest beings, not from that natural level, from something as unpredictable as an organism that exists much like a stone and other such things, that's unbearable for us.

[CLS] self-deception brilliant descended level things feeling highest natural unpredictable organism [SEP] so we can't bear these things. [SEP] things true prevent people finding [SEP]
[CLS] things bear [SEP] we have to prevent people from finding about things, especially when they're true. [SEP] leaves show slowly mechanism disappears illustrate traces lead grandiose image [SEP]
[CLS] things true prevent people finding [SEP] to show you how slowly this mechanism disappears and to illustrate the traces it leaves, which lead to something other than this grandiose image of ourselves, i would like to share another story with you. [SEP] story opinion nice [SEP]
[CLS] leaves show slowly mechanism disappears illustrate traces lead grandiose image [SEP] a particularly nice story, in my opinion. [SEP] wife told [SEP]

[CLS] brigade fire [SEP] and because i'm with the fire brigade, i'm interested in pyrotechnical things. [SEP] point sense feeling nervous [SEP]
[CLS] brigade things fire interested pyrotechnical [SEP] yes, you'll sense it if you're feeling a little nervous at this point, something is not quite right. [SEP] word wife told person morally justify replace [SEP]
[CLS] point sense feeling nervous [SEP] i told my wife, whenever a person uses the word because to morally justify something, we should try to replace it with the word although. [SEP] sentence brigade things fire interested pyrotechnical [SEP]
[CLS] word wife told person morally justify replace [SEP] you do this and then you'll see the sentence, although i'm with the fire brigade, i'm interested in pyrotechnical things. [SEP] sentence sense actual truth [SEP]
[CLS] sentence brigade things fire interested pyrotechnical [SEP] you sense that that ‘ s the actual truth behind the sentence. [SEP] fires young lad interested putting [SEP]

[CLS] signed [SEP] and moreover, you don't tell your teacher that you like to set fires and are happy when the fire flares up. [SEP] fire simply lot show responsible removing danger create set [SEP]
[CLS] teacher set happy flares fires fire [SEP] no, it simply looks a lot better when we show that we're responsible for removing the danger that others create when they set a fire. [SEP] mechanism [SEP]
[CLS] fire simply lot show responsible removing danger create set [SEP] here you have this little mechanism. [SEP] knew deep fire loud hint fact boy connection [SEP]
[CLS] mechanism [SEP] this this hint at the fact that the boy knew, deep within, that his connection is really with the fire, but that he can't say that out loud. [SEP] conscious censor unconscious switches immediately shapes things sound lot [SEP]
[CLS] knew deep fire loud hint fact boy connection [SEP] here you have the censor between the unconscious and the conscious, which switches on immediately before you can do anything about it, and which shapes things you know look very different in such a way that they might sound a lot better for you and others. [SEP] correctness words language political [SEP]
[CLS] conscious censor unconscious switches immediately shapes things sound lot [SEP] in this way certain words come into being that we also use again and again in the language of political correctness. [SEP] true [SEP]
[CLS] correctness words language political [SEP] we know that something else is really true. [SEP] loud social disturbed relationships sensitively [SEP]
[CLS] true [SEP] but we know that if we were to say that out loud, social relationships will be sensitively disturbed. [SEP]  [SEP]

[CLS]  [SEP] it is impossible to present such things in a society that is supposed to function. [SEP] institute present found [SEP]
[CLS] function impossible present things society supposed [SEP] i'd now like to present to you what we found out at our institute. [SEP] reality deception self-deception minds logic disseminate willingness present valid unconscious [SEP]
[CLS] institute present found [SEP] according to which logic do we disseminate this deception, this self-deception, this willingness to present a reality that's different from the reality we know is valid in our unconscious minds? [SEP] present illustrate [SEP]
[CLS] reality deception self-deception minds logic disseminate willingness present valid unconscious [SEP] i would like to present to you two, perhaps three examples to illustrate this. [SEP] works presumption [SEP]
[CLS] present illustrate [SEP] the first example works with the presumption of something many of you know and some of you value, and only very few of you don't need at all. [SEP] soul talking [SEP]
[CLS] works presumption [SEP] i'm talking about the soul. [SEP] soul [SEP]
[CLS] soul talking [SEP] what is the soul? [SEP] mental leibniz soul [SEP]
[CLS] soul [SEP] the soul is something mental, leibniz said. [SEP] tangible material nature [SEP]
[CLS] mental leibniz soul [SEP] it does not have a tangible, material nature. [SEP] soul ephemeral insignificant life lines material blood solid speak bound [SEP]
[CLS] tangible material nature [SEP] and when you are with people who are firmly convinced that you have a soul, or, you might say, who believe that the soul brought us to life, then imagine something along these lines: the soul is an incorporeal framework around you, and it's not material, and you are just made of flesh and blood, are solid, so to speak, bound to the earth, ephemeral, subject to decay, insignificant, dead really. [SEP] nature latin air soul cloud airy called anima breath [SEP]
[CLS] soul ephemeral insignificant life lines material blood solid speak bound [SEP] and now you see the soul as having something of a cloud like nature, an airy nature, it's called anima in latin, being like a breath of air. [SEP] human dignity mind soul breath air pours filled nature live [SEP]
[CLS] nature latin air soul cloud airy called anima breath [SEP] and when this breath of air pours out onto a human, the human is filled with dignity, with mind, with nature that can only live with a soul. [SEP] leave [SEP]
[CLS] human dignity mind soul breath air pours filled nature live [SEP] and then it can leave you. [SEP] works people imagine soul [SEP]
[CLS] leave [SEP] that's how people imagine the soul works. [SEP] human [SEP]
[CLS] works people imagine soul [SEP] that it comes to the human from outside. [SEP] lives supposed view present [SEP]
[CLS] human [SEP] we are supposed to view it as something that must be present in our lives. [SEP] condition lie understand logic joy feel improve world [SEP]
[CLS] lives supposed view present [SEP] and if you think of this condition, then you'll understand the logic behind the joy we feel when we can improve the world through a lie. [SEP] implement rule [SEP]
[CLS] condition lie understand logic joy feel improve world [SEP] because now you can implement a rule of three. [SEP] school remember rule [SEP]
[CLS] implement rule [SEP] you'll remember the rule of three from school. [SEP] rule describes logic [SEP]
[CLS] school remember rule [SEP] this is a rule of three, which describes a logic to us. [SEP] presentation complicated part [SEP]
[CLS] rule describes logic [SEP] this, by the way, is the most complicated part of my presentation. [SEP] lie logic willingness [SEP]
[CLS] presentation complicated part [SEP] you'll need some logic here, but also the willingness to lie. [SEP] lie simply implement logic wrong [SEP]
[CLS] lie logic willingness [SEP] namely to lie in such a way that you can simply implement this logic in the wrong way. [SEP] theorems rule [SEP]
[CLS] lie simply implement logic wrong [SEP] this rule of three contains three theorems. [SEP] klaus soul theorem claims [SEP]
[CLS] theorems rule [SEP] the first theorem is, klaus claims there is no soul. [SEP] soul theorem klaus [SEP]
[CLS] klaus soul theorem claims [SEP] the second theorem is thus, if klaus is right, then he doesn't have a soul. [SEP] theorem [SEP]
[CLS] soul theorem klaus [SEP] now we have the third theorem. [SEP] highlighted [SEP]
[CLS] theorem [SEP] i highlighted it here. [SEP] soul theorem turn people strong attachment idea [SEP]
[CLS] highlighted [SEP] a third theorem which will turn up in people who have a strong attachment to the idea of a soul. [SEP] person soul dead claim [SEP]
[CLS] soul theorem turn people strong attachment idea [SEP] they will say, a person who has no soul is dead and can't claim anything. [SEP] sense [SEP]
[CLS] person soul dead claim [SEP] so you sense it already. [SEP] discourse logic expressed deceptive [SEP]
[CLS] sense [SEP] here this logic is expressed in this deceptive discourse. [SEP] straight [SEP]
[CLS] discourse logic expressed deceptive [SEP] you see it straight away. [SEP] correct theorems logically [SEP]
[CLS] straight [SEP] the first two theorems are logically correct. [SEP] claim [SEP]
[CLS] correct theorems logically [SEP] i can claim anything. [SEP] logic reality make statements [SEP]
[CLS] claim [SEP] logic does not make any statements about reality. [SEP] man german chancellor [SEP]
[CLS] logic reality make statements [SEP] i can say, the german chancellor is a man. [SEP] man chancellor [SEP]
[CLS] man german chancellor [SEP] and if i'm right, then the chancellor is a man. [SEP] man chancellor [SEP]
[CLS] man chancellor [SEP] if i'm not right, then the chancellor is not a man. [SEP] logic valid make statement [SEP]
[CLS] man chancellor [SEP] logic does not make any statement about what is valid. [SEP] claim [SEP]
[CLS] logic valid make statement [SEP] i can claim anything. [SEP] decisive valid [SEP]
[CLS] claim [SEP] what is decisive, if i'm right, then it's valid. [SEP] soul klaus [SEP]
[CLS] decisive valid [SEP] so when klaus says, there is no soul. [SEP] soul [SEP]
[CLS] soul klaus [SEP] secondly, if he's right, then he doesn't have a soul. [SEP] correct things logically [SEP]
[CLS] soul [SEP] these things are logically correct. [SEP] senses deceptive consciousness immediately [SEP]
[CLS] correct things logically [SEP] and now our deceptive consciousness immediately senses, i can do something with this. [SEP] priority theorem attaches acts opposite proven theorems [SEP]
[CLS] senses deceptive consciousness immediately [SEP] so it attaches a third theorem to it, that has nothing to do with the first two theorems and only acts as if the opposite of the first theorem had already been proven and given priority. [SEP] prove soul exists [SEP]
[CLS] priority theorem attaches acts opposite proven theorems [SEP] because we'd really have to prove whether the soul exists or not. [SEP] logic lie fact theorems logically correct attaches save [SEP]
[CLS] prove soul exists [SEP] but with this logic, which just uses the fact that two theorems are logically correct and attaches a third one, which looks like it has something to do with the others, we can save our lie. [SEP] soul act impossible live [SEP]
[CLS] logic lie fact theorems logically correct attaches save [SEP] so we act as if it were impossible to live without a soul. [SEP] happy [SEP]
[CLS] soul act impossible live [SEP] and we're very happy about it. [SEP] apply things [SEP]
[CLS] happy [SEP] we can apply these things to other examples. [SEP] newspapers present modern repeatedly item daily [SEP]
[CLS] apply things [SEP] at present at we have a very modern example, which is repeatedly an item in the daily newspapers. [SEP] theme slow-burner close hand philosophical [SEP]
[CLS] newspapers present modern repeatedly item daily [SEP] here you have to keep another philosophical theme, a philosophical slow-burner, close to hand. [SEP] fourteenth back [SEP]
[CLS] theme slow-burner close hand philosophical [SEP] that has to do with us going back to the fourteenth [SEP] century [SEP]
[CLS] fourteenth back [SEP] century. [SEP] buridan scholar called jean ass named [SEP]

[CLS] thing natural [SEP] and if you put it exactly between two equally big haystacks, it will starve. [SEP] haystack [SEP]
[CLS] haystacks starve put equally big [SEP] because it doesn't know which haystack it should go to first. [SEP] middle [SEP]
[CLS] haystack [SEP] so it's right in the middle. [SEP] imagined things nature [SEP]
[CLS] middle [SEP] that's how things of nature are imagined. [SEP] equally large forces opposite signsnatures cancel [SEP]

[CLS] make haystack bigger sense [SEP] he'll automatically go to the right thought. [SEP] driven determined imagine nature larger haystack immediately attracts quickly feeling [SEP]
[CLS] thought automatically [SEP] if you imagine this, that in nature you are somehow driven, determined by the larger haystack that immediately attracts you, you will also quickly have the feeling that there must be something like a free will.

[CLS] theorem wolf singer free [SEP] these theorems are absolutely logical and correct. [SEP] theorem thing read daily papers find [SEP]
[CLS] correct theorems absolutely logical [SEP] and now the thing you can almost read daily in the papers is what you find in this third theorem. [SEP] mind responsible free held actions claims unsound [SEP]
[CLS] theorem thing read daily papers find [SEP] it looks something like this, somebody who does not have free will cannot be held responsible responsible for his actions and claims and is thus of unsound mind. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] mind responsible free held actions claims unsound [SEP] here you have it again. [SEP] prove free [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] really, you'd have to prove, first of all, whether there is something like a free will. [SEP] start proof logic deception act theorem false accept opposite [SEP]
[CLS] prove free [SEP] but the logic of deception allows us to act as if the first theorem were false from the start, so of course you'd have accept the opposite without any proof. [SEP] simply happy practice lie test make people courage [SEP]
[CLS] start proof logic deception act theorem false accept opposite [SEP] and now you can simply, if you want to test something for yourself and especially if you want to make people happy, practice this courage to lie. [SEP] practice predictors meet person [SEP]
[CLS] simply happy practice lie test make people courage [SEP] practice it when you meet a person and then say, there are no predictors. [SEP] predictors prophet german word [SEP]
[CLS] practice predictors meet person [SEP] and don't use the german word for predictors, which would be prophet. [SEP] incorrect politically [SEP]
[CLS] predictors prophet german word [SEP] you mustn't say that, because that would be a little politically incorrect. [SEP] predictors [SEP]
[CLS] incorrect politically [SEP] say, there are no predictors. [SEP] predictors immediately hear matter prove [SEP]

[CLS] load bottom [SEP] we were given very accurate data. [SEP] plant power quantities system wind solar generally back-up feed network [SEP]
[CLS] data accurate [SEP] and the wind power plant or the solar power plant or whatever it is is generally a back-up system, or a system that can only feed into the network in small quantities. [SEP] objective simply [SEP]
[CLS] plant power quantities system wind solar generally back-up feed network [SEP] our objective was to simply say, okay, [SEP] wind part diesel back-up sun serve load form bigger [SEP]
[CLS] objective simply [SEP] the diesel will be the back-up and the wind, the sun will serve the load in such a way that they can form the bigger part. [SEP] twenty thirty energies diesel exceed percent renewable switch [SEP]
[CLS] wind part diesel back-up sun serve load form bigger [SEP] and if you want to exceed twenty, thirty percent renewable energies, you have to switch off diesel. [SEP] network moment renewable energies entire [SEP]
[CLS] twenty thirty energies diesel exceed percent renewable switch [SEP] that means that at that moment you have to see to it that the renewable energies can take over the entire network. [SEP] managed [SEP]
[CLS] network moment renewable energies entire [SEP] of course you can only do that if you're being managed here somehow. [SEP] planet [SEP]

[CLS] hall diesel network battery converters brought aggregates size complete dynamic [SEP] over here we simulate the entire transmission guidance system, the cable's kilometer physics, to illustrate the vibration behavior, so to speak, in the network. [SEP] thing [SEP]
[CLS] system physics behavior speak network simulate entire transmission guidance cable [SEP] and here can you see the whole thing again. [SEP] kilowatt network add photo voltaic output hundred [SEP]
[CLS] thing [SEP] we can also add a photo voltaic output of two hundred kilowatt + to the network. [SEP] diesel individual aggregates [SEP]
[CLS] kilowatt network add photo voltaic output hundred [SEP] we can see it again here we can see the diesel again here, and all the individual aggregates here. [SEP] thousand developed today twelve systems hall completed practically electronically terms [SEP]
[CLS] diesel individual aggregates [SEP] and what we did, the hall was completed in two thousand and nine, and until today, two thousand and twelve, we developed practically everything that could be developed electronically and in terms of software between the individual systems. [SEP] theme battery manufacturers define company stands network lies [SEP]
[CLS] thousand developed today twelve systems hall completed practically electronically terms [SEP] so we're not battery manufacturers, but define ourselves as a company that stands between the theme of the battery and the theme of the network and everything else that lies between the two. [SEP] network complicated cater battery [SEP]
[CLS] theme battery manufacturers define company stands network lies [SEP] you have to be able to cater for the battery of course, and for the network, and that is very complicated. [SEP] island energies nice thing topic basically anticipate problems increase share [SEP]
[CLS] network complicated cater battery [SEP] the nice thing about this topic is that on this island, you can basically anticipate all the problems we will have if we want to increase our share of renewable energies. [SEP] energy moved revolution island percent sun discussion things bring excess [SEP]
[CLS] island energies nice thing topic basically anticipate problems increase share [SEP] so this whole discussion as to how things will be moved, the energy revolution, how to bring that about, on the island, for example, we have twenty-five-thirty percent excess energy, so we have to limit the wind and sun. [SEP] grid lends smart [SEP]
[CLS] energy moved revolution island percent sun discussion things bring excess [SEP] of course this lends itself to a smart grid. [SEP] smart grids hot topic moment [SEP]
[CLS] grid lends smart [SEP] smart grids are a hot topic at the moment everywhere. [SEP] managed start integrating electro-mobility island load [SEP]
[CLS] smart grids hot topic moment [SEP] we can start integrating electro-mobility on the island already, and to ask around whether the load can be managed. [SEP] energies reservoir seventy percent renewable [SEP]
[CLS] managed start integrating electro-mobility island load [SEP] that means that if you're at seventy percent renewable energies, then you won't be able to do that without a reservoir. [SEP] grids networks completely heed share smart developing reservoir [SEP]
[CLS] energies reservoir seventy percent renewable [SEP] you can heed the share by using one of these smart grids, by developing the networks, yes, that should definitely be done, but you'll never be able to do without the reservoir completely. [SEP] message kind [SEP]
[CLS] grids networks completely heed share smart developing reservoir [SEP] and that's kind of the message. [SEP] arise people problems [SEP]
[CLS] message kind [SEP] that's why many people come and look at it, because you can see what problems will arise. [SEP] diesel mass network turn longer rotating amount idleness [SEP]
[CLS] arise people problems [SEP] if we turn off the diesel, then you will no longer have this rotating mass, which causes a certain amount of idleness in the network. [SEP] plants europe european energy grid basically consists rotating masses large [SEP]
[CLS] diesel mass network turn longer rotating amount idleness [SEP] and our european energy grid basically consists of rotating masses of large power plants, where the axle always revolves around the whole of europe. [SEP] hertz network valves enter fifty turns forty point start open [SEP]
[CLS] plants europe european energy grid basically consists rotating masses large [SEP] we look into this network, see the fifty hertz, and if it turns into forty nine point nine hertz, we start to open a few small valves, then a little more steam can enter, and then it goes up again.

[CLS] hertz network valves enter fifty turns forty point start open [SEP] that's the system. [SEP] slow incredibly [SEP]
[CLS] system [SEP] and of course that's incredibly slow. [SEP] put [SEP]
[CLS] slow incredibly [SEP] if you put that down somewhere, it takes a while. [SEP] stable spinning reserve ten network [SEP]
[CLS] put [SEP] the spinning reserve has at least ten seconds to keep the network stable. [SEP] differently time react [SEP]
[CLS] stable spinning reserve ten network [SEP] and in that time you can react differently. [SEP] anymore electro-chemistry rotating mass replace power electronics [SEP]
[CLS] differently time react [SEP] if you don't have this rotating mass anymore, then you have to replace it with power electronics and electro-chemistry. [SEP] milliseconds battery switch [SEP]
[CLS] anymore electro-chemistry rotating mass replace power electronics [SEP] and with this battery we can switch it on and off once for two milliseconds. [SEP] enormous potential speed [SEP]
[CLS] milliseconds battery switch [SEP] so you see what enormous potential for speed there is here. [SEP] thirty twenty percent masses message make rotating reach goal [SEP]
[CLS] enormous potential speed [SEP] and so the message is this, we have to make do without these rotating masses, if we actually want to reach our goal of twenty, twenty, twenty percent, twenty, thirty, thirty percent etc. [SEP] network decrease must-run capacities [SEP]
[CLS] thirty twenty percent masses message make rotating reach goal [SEP] and then we have to decrease our must-run capacities in the network. [SEP] must-run frequency simply power plant running [SEP]
[CLS] network decrease must-run capacities [SEP] must-run simply means the power plant is running too to keep up the frequency. [SEP] moment additional plants turbines huge debate construction coal-burning power gas [SEP]
[CLS] must-run frequency simply power plant running [SEP] yes, this is a huge debate at the moment, additional construction of coal-burning power plants, because otherwise we wouldn't have, or gas turbines, because that's not possible. [SEP] capacities demonstrate decrease must-run putting electrochemical reservoirs network [SEP]
[CLS] moment additional plants turbines huge debate construction coal-burning power gas [SEP] and we're just trying to demonstrate that we can decrease the capacities, the must-run capacities, by putting electrochemical reservoirs in the network too. [SEP] thankfully topic studies carried [SEP]

[CLS] age typical mortality chart organized [SEP] this tool that i'm using here is a little experiment. [SEP] accidents deaths pivot called choose filter [SEP]
[CLS] experiment tool [SEP] it's called pivot, and with pivot what i can do is i can choose to filter in one particular cause of deaths -- say, accidents. [SEP] emerges pattern [SEP]
[CLS] accidents deaths pivot called choose filter [SEP] and, right away, i see there's a different pattern that emerges. [SEP] people active frail mid-area [SEP]
[CLS] emerges pattern [SEP] this is because, in the mid-area here, people are at their most active, and over here they're at their most frail. [SEP] death suspects step back reorganize data circulatory diseases cancer usual [SEP]
[CLS] people active frail mid-area [SEP] we can step back out again and then reorganize the data by cause of death, seeing that circulatory diseases and cancer are the usual suspects, but not for everyone. [SEP] age years ahead filter accidents greatest people worried [SEP]
[CLS] death suspects step back reorganize data circulatory diseases cancer usual [SEP] if we go ahead and we filter by age -- say 40 years or less -- we see that accidents are actually the greatest cause that people have to be worried about. [SEP] men drill case [SEP]
[CLS] age years ahead filter accidents greatest people worried [SEP] and if you drill into that, it's especially the case for men. [SEP] info-graphic viewing information idea data lot swimming living [SEP]
[CLS] men drill case [SEP] so you get the idea that viewing information, viewing data in this way, is a lot like swimming in a living information info-graphic. [SEP] data raw content [SEP]
[CLS] info-graphic viewing information idea data lot swimming living [SEP] and if we can do this for raw data, why not do it for content as well? [SEP] produced cover single sports illustrated [SEP]
[CLS] data raw content [SEP] so what we have right here is the cover of every single sports illustrated ever produced. [SEP] web [SEP]
[CLS] produced cover single sports illustrated [SEP] it's all here; it's all on the web. [SEP] talk back rooms [SEP]
[CLS] web [SEP] you can go back to your rooms and try this after my talk. [SEP] pivot decade drill [SEP]
[CLS] talk back rooms [SEP] with pivot, you can drill into a decade. [SEP] year drill [SEP]
[CLS] pivot decade drill [SEP] you can drill into a particular year. [SEP] issue jump specific [SEP]
[CLS] year drill [SEP] you can jump right into a specific issue. [SEP] issue sports athletes appeared [SEP]
[CLS] issue jump specific [SEP] so i'm looking at this; i see the athletes that have appeared in this issue, the sports. [SEP] lance armstrong fan reveals ahead click issues part [SEP]
[CLS] issue sports athletes appeared [SEP] i'm a lance armstrong fan, so i'll go ahead and i'll click on that, which reveals, for me, all the issues in which lance armstrong's been a part of. [SEP] cycling kind peek taking [SEP]
[CLS] lance armstrong fan reveals ahead click issues part [SEP] now, if i want to just kind of take a peek at these, i might think, "well, what about taking a look at all of cycling?" [SEP] back step expand [SEP]
[CLS] cycling kind peek taking [SEP] so i can step back, and expand on that. [SEP] greg lemond [SEP]
[CLS] back step expand [SEP] and i see greg lemond now. [SEP] backing broader narrower searching browsing idea navigate information [SEP]
[CLS] greg lemond [SEP] and so you get the idea that when you navigate over information this way -- going narrower, broader, backing in, backing out -- you're not searching, you're not browsing. [SEP] bit [SEP]
[CLS] backing broader narrower searching browsing idea navigate information [SEP] you're doing something that's actually a little bit different. [SEP] information [SEP]
[CLS] bit [SEP] it's in between, and we think it changes the way information can be used. [SEP] crazy bit extrapolate idea [SEP]
[CLS] information [SEP] so i want to extrapolate on this idea a bit with something that's a little bit crazy. [SEP] summary single wikipedia page reduced [SEP]
[CLS] crazy bit extrapolate idea [SEP] what we're done here is we've taken every single wikipedia page and we reduced it down to a little summary. [SEP] summary consists synopsis icon topical area [SEP]
[CLS] summary single wikipedia page reduced [SEP] so the summary consists of just a little synopsis and an icon to indicate the topical area that it comes from. [SEP] top showing popular wikipedia pages [SEP]
[CLS] summary consists synopsis icon topical area [SEP] i'm only showing the top 500 most popular wikipedia pages right here. [SEP] view things limited lot [SEP]
[CLS] top showing popular wikipedia pages [SEP] but even in this limited view, we can do a lot of things. [SEP] wikipedia sense topical domains popular [SEP]
[CLS] view things limited lot [SEP] right away, we get a sense of what are the topical domains that are most popular on wikipedia. [SEP] government ahead select [SEP]
[CLS] wikipedia sense topical domains popular [SEP] i'm going to go ahead and select government. [SEP] government year selected wikipedia categories frequently correspond time magazine people [SEP]
[CLS] government ahead select [SEP] now, having selected government, i can now see that the wikipedia categories that most frequently correspond to that are time magazine people of the year. [SEP] page important insight contained wikipedia [SEP]
[CLS] government year selected wikipedia categories frequently correspond time magazine people [SEP] so this is really important because this is an insight that was not contained within any one wikipedia page. [SEP] insight step back [SEP]
[CLS] page important insight contained wikipedia [SEP] it's only possible to see that insight when you step back and look at all of them. [SEP] summaries year bringing drill concept time magazine person [SEP]
[CLS] insight step back [SEP] looking at one of these particular summaries, i can then drill into the concept of time magazine person of the year, bringing up all of them. [SEP] people government sciences fewer business boss music majority natural [SEP]
[CLS] summaries year bringing drill concept time magazine person [SEP] so looking at these people, i can see that the majority come from government; some have come from natural sciences; some, fewer still, have come from business -- there's my boss -- and one has come from music. [SEP] bono winner interestingly ted prize [SEP]
[CLS] people government sciences fewer business boss music majority natural [SEP] and interestingly enough, bono is also a ted prize winner. [SEP] jump winners ted prize [SEP]
[CLS] bono winner interestingly ted prize [SEP] so we can go, jump, and take a look at all the ted prize winners. [SEP] abstraction web navigating time higher level [SEP]
[CLS] jump winners ted prize [SEP] so you see, we're navigating the web for the first time as if it's actually a web, not from page-to-page, but at a higher level of abstraction. [SEP] surprise show thing catch bit [SEP]
[CLS] abstraction web navigating time higher level [SEP] and so i want to show you one other thing that may catch you a little bit by surprise. [SEP] showing york times website [SEP]
[CLS] surprise show thing catch bit [SEP] i'm just showing the new york times website here. [SEP] browser web pivot application call view bring zoomable technology single [SEP]
[CLS] showing york times website [SEP] so pivot, this application -- i don't want to call it a browser; it's really not a browser, but you can view web pages with it -- and we bring that zoomable technology to every single web page like this. [SEP] pop section back step specific [SEP]
[CLS] browser web pivot application call view bring zoomable technology single [SEP] so i can step back, pop right back into a specific section. [SEP] reason important virtue viewing web pages entire browsing history exact [SEP]
[CLS] pop section back step specific [SEP] now the reason why this is important is because, by virtue of just viewing web pages in this way, i can look at my entire browsing history in the exact same way. [SEP] frames drill specific time [SEP]
[CLS] reason important virtue viewing web pages entire browsing history exact [SEP] so i can drill into what i've done over specific time frames. [SEP] fact gave state demo [SEP]
[CLS] frames drill specific time [SEP] here, in fact, is the state of all the demo that i just gave. [SEP] today sort replay stuff earlier [SEP]
[CLS] fact gave state demo [SEP] and i can sort of replay some stuff that i was looking at earlier today. [SEP] history searching bing pivot step back slice dice search nepotistic [SEP]
[CLS] today sort replay stuff earlier [SEP] and, if i want to step back and look at everything, i can slice and dice my history, perhaps by my search history -- here, i was doing some nepotistic searching, looking for bing, over here for live labs pivot. [SEP] drill web page launch [SEP]
[CLS] history searching bing pivot step back slice dice search nepotistic [SEP] and from these, i can drill into the web page and just launch them again. [SEP] times data metaphor repurposed multiple case makes greater sum parts [SEP]
[CLS] drill web page launch [SEP] it's one metaphor repurposed multiple times, and in each case it makes the whole greater than the sum of the parts with the data. [SEP] world curse data [SEP]
[CLS] times data metaphor repurposed multiple case makes greater sum parts [SEP] so right now, in this world, we think about data as being this curse. [SEP] overload talk curse information [SEP]
[CLS] world curse data [SEP] we talk about the curse of information overload. [SEP] data talk drowning [SEP]
[CLS] overload talk curse information [SEP] we talk about drowning in data. [SEP] things upside turn hidden thing web navigating habit patterns [SEP]
[CLS] data talk drowning [SEP] what if we can actually turn that upside down and turn the web upside down, so that instead of navigating from one thing to the next, we get used to the habit of being able to go from many things to many things, and then being able to see the patterns that were otherwise hidden? [SEP] data information trapped extract [SEP]
[CLS] things upside turn hidden thing web navigating habit patterns [SEP] if we can do that, then instead of being trapped in data, we might actually extract information. [SEP] information knowledge dealing tease [SEP]
[CLS] data information trapped extract [SEP] and, instead of dealing just with information, we can tease out knowledge. [SEP] knowledge found wisdom [SEP]
[CLS] information knowledge dealing tease [SEP] and if we get the knowledge, then maybe even there's wisdom to be found. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] knowledge found wisdom [SEP] so with that, i thank you. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] i grew up on a steady diet of science fiction. [SEP] day school high bus hour [SEP]
[CLS] fiction grew steady diet science [SEP] in high school, i took a bus to school an hour each way every day. [SEP] book science worlds satisfied form absorbed fiction mind narrative insatiable [SEP]
[CLS] day school high bus hour [SEP] and i was always absorbed in a book, science fiction book, which took my mind to other worlds, and satisfied, in a narrative form, this insatiable sense of curiosity that i had. [SEP] samples woods hiking taking frogs water back microscope curiosity manifested [SEP]
[CLS] book science worlds satisfied form absorbed fiction mind narrative insatiable [SEP] and you know, that curiosity also manifested itself in the fact that whenever i wasn't in school i was out in the woods, hiking and taking "samples" -- frogs and snakes and bugs and pond water -- and bringing it back, looking at it under the microscope. [SEP] geek real science [SEP]
[CLS] samples woods hiking taking frogs water back microscope curiosity manifested [SEP] you know, i was a real science geek. [SEP] understand world possibility limits [SEP]
[CLS] geek real science [SEP] but it was all about trying to understand the world, understand the limits of possibility. [SEP] happening late moon oceans love science fiction mirrored world exploring [SEP]
[CLS] understand world possibility limits [SEP] and my love of science fiction actually seemed mirrored in the world around me, because what was happening, this was in the late '60s, we were going to the moon, we were exploring the deep oceans. [SEP] jacques imagined cousteau coming living rooms amazing specials showed animals [SEP]
[CLS] happening late moon oceans love science fiction mirrored world exploring [SEP] jacques cousteau was coming into our living rooms with his amazing specials that showed us animals and places and a wondrous world that we could never really have previously imagined. [SEP] resonate science fiction part [SEP]
[CLS] jacques imagined cousteau coming living rooms amazing specials showed animals [SEP] so, that seemed to resonate with the whole science fiction part of it. [SEP] artist [SEP]
[CLS] resonate science fiction part [SEP] and i was an artist. [SEP] draw paint [SEP]
[CLS] artist [SEP] i could draw. i could paint. [SEP] landscape head found video games saturation movies imagery media create [SEP]
[CLS] draw paint [SEP] and i found that because there weren't video games and this saturation of cg movies and all of this imagery in the media landscape, i had to create these images in my head. [SEP] book description put heads kids read author movie screen [SEP]
[CLS] landscape head found video games saturation movies imagery media create [SEP] you know, we all did, as kids having to read a book, and through the author's description, put something on the movie screen in our heads. [SEP] robots spaceships alien paint creatures worlds stuff response draw [SEP]
[CLS] book description put heads kids read author movie screen [SEP] and so, my response to this was to paint, to draw alien creatures, alien worlds, robots, spaceships, all that stuff. [SEP] textbook endlessly busted math class doodling [SEP]
[CLS] robots spaceships alien paint creatures worlds stuff response draw [SEP] i was endlessly getting busted in math class doodling behind the textbook. [SEP] creativity find outlet [SEP]
[CLS] textbook endlessly busted math class doodling [SEP] that was -- the creativity had to find its outlet somehow. [SEP] happened earth interesting thing jacques cousteau shows excited fact alien [SEP]
[CLS] creativity find outlet [SEP] and an interesting thing happened: the jacques cousteau shows actually got me very excited about the fact that there was an alien world right here on earth. [SEP] someday alien world spaceship pretty darn [SEP]
[CLS] happened earth interesting thing jacques cousteau shows excited fact alien [SEP] i might not really go to an alien world on a spaceship someday -- that seemed pretty darn unlikely. [SEP] earth books world rich exotic imagined reading [SEP]
[CLS] someday alien world spaceship pretty darn [SEP] but that was a world i could really go to, right here on earth, that was as rich and exotic as anything that i had imagined from reading these books. [SEP] decided scuba diver age [SEP]
[CLS] earth books world rich exotic imagined reading [SEP] so, i decided i was going to become a scuba diver at the age of 15. [SEP] canada miles ocean problem lived village nearest [SEP]
[CLS] decided scuba diver age [SEP] and the only problem with that was that i lived in a little village in canada, 600 miles from the nearest ocean. [SEP] daunt [SEP]
[CLS] canada miles ocean problem lived village nearest [SEP] but i didn't let that daunt me. [SEP] buffalo york live pestered father finally found scuba class border [SEP]
[CLS] daunt [SEP] i pestered my father until he finally found a scuba class in buffalo, new york, right across the border from where we live. [SEP] buffalo york certified pool ymca dead winter [SEP]
[CLS] buffalo york live pestered father finally found scuba class border [SEP] and i actually got certified in a pool at a ymca in the dead of winter in buffalo, new york. [SEP] ocean years california real moved [SEP]
[CLS] buffalo york certified pool ymca dead winter [SEP] and i didn't see the ocean, a real ocean, for another two years, until we moved to california. [SEP] years hours intervening underwater submersibles spent [SEP]
[CLS] ocean years california real moved [SEP] since then, in the intervening 40 years, i've spent about 3,000 hours underwater, and 500 hours of that was in submersibles. [SEP] environment oceans imagination learned deep-ocean shallow rich amazing life [SEP]
[CLS] years hours intervening underwater submersibles spent [SEP] and i've learned that that deep-ocean environment, and even the shallow oceans, are so rich with amazing life that really is beyond our imagination. [SEP] nature imagination boundless compared meager human [SEP]
[CLS] environment oceans imagination learned deep-ocean shallow rich amazing life [SEP] nature's imagination is so boundless compared to our own meager human imagination. [SEP] day stand dives absolute awe make [SEP]
[CLS] nature imagination boundless compared meager human [SEP] i still, to this day, stand in absolute awe of what i see when i make these dives. [SEP] ongoing love affair ocean strong [SEP]
[CLS] day stand dives absolute awe make [SEP] and my love affair with the ocean is ongoing, and just as strong as it ever was. [SEP] adult filmmaking chose career [SEP]
[CLS] ongoing love affair ocean strong [SEP] but when i chose a career as an adult, it was filmmaking. [SEP] images reconcile stories create urge urges [SEP]
[CLS] adult filmmaking chose career [SEP] and that seemed to be the best way to reconcile this urge i had to tell stories with my urges to create images. [SEP] kid constantly books drawing comic [SEP]
[CLS] images reconcile stories create urge urges [SEP] and i was, as a kid, constantly drawing comic books, and so on. [SEP] filmmaking sense put pictures stories made [SEP]
[CLS] kid constantly books drawing comic [SEP] so, filmmaking was the way to put pictures and stories together, and that made sense. [SEP] terminator aliens abyss stories chose science fiction [SEP]
[CLS] filmmaking sense put pictures stories made [SEP] and of course the stories that i chose to tell were science fiction stories: "terminator," "aliens" and "the abyss." [SEP] abyss filmmaking putting love underwater diving [SEP]
[CLS] terminator aliens abyss stories chose science fiction [SEP] and with "the abyss," i was putting together my love of underwater and diving with filmmaking. [SEP] merging passions [SEP]
[CLS] abyss filmmaking putting love underwater diving [SEP] so, you know, merging the two passions. [SEP] abyss film creature animation interesting solve specific narrative problem create [SEP]
[CLS] merging passions [SEP] something interesting came out of "the abyss," which was that to solve a specific narrative problem on that film, which was to create this kind of liquid water creature, we actually embraced computer generated animation, cg. [SEP] character movie resulted soft-surface animation [SEP]
[CLS] abyss film creature animation interesting solve specific narrative problem create [SEP] and this resulted in the first soft-surface character, cg animation that was ever in a movie. [SEP] audience money barely amazing magic film make broke witnessed global [SEP]
[CLS] character movie resulted soft-surface animation [SEP] and even though the film didn't make any money -- barely broke even, i should say -- i witnessed something amazing, which is that the audience, the global audience, was mesmerized by this apparent magic. [SEP] magic arthur clarke law sufficiently advanced technology indistinguishable [SEP]
[CLS] audience money barely amazing magic film make broke witnessed global [SEP] you know, it's arthur clarke's law that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. [SEP] magical [SEP]
[CLS] magic arthur clarke law sufficiently advanced technology indistinguishable [SEP] they were seeing something magical. [SEP] excited [SEP]
[CLS] magical [SEP] and so that got me very excited. [SEP] wow thought art embraced cinematic [SEP]
[CLS] excited [SEP] and i thought, "wow, this is something that needs to be embraced into the cinematic art." [SEP] terminator film farther [SEP]
[CLS] wow thought art embraced cinematic [SEP] so, with "terminator 2," which was my next film, we took that much farther. [SEP] working ilm film created liquid metal dude work success hung [SEP]
[CLS] terminator film farther [SEP] working with ilm, we created the liquid metal dude in that film. the success hung in the balance on whether that effect would work. [SEP] audience created magic result make money [SEP]
[CLS] working ilm film created liquid metal dude work success hung [SEP] and it did, and we created magic again, and we had the same result with an audience -- although we did make a little more money on that one. [SEP] world drawing artists line dots experience creativity film [SEP]
[CLS] audience created magic result make money [SEP] so, drawing a line through those two dots of experience came to, "this is going to be a whole new world," this was a whole new world of creativity for film artists. [SEP] winston stan time domain started company good friend premier make-up [SEP]
[CLS] world drawing artists line dots experience creativity film [SEP] so, i started a company with stan winston, my good friend stan winston, who is the premier make-up and creature designer at that time, and it was called digital domain. [SEP] production concept company leapfrog past analog processes optical printers digital [SEP]
[CLS] winston stan time domain started company good friend premier make-up [SEP] and the concept of the company was that we would leapfrog past the analog processes of optical printers and so on, and we would go right to digital production. [SEP] gave competitive advantage [SEP]
[CLS] production concept company leapfrog past analog processes optical printers digital [SEP] and we actually did that and it gave us a competitive advantage for a while. [SEP] mid found lagging creature character design stuff founded company [SEP]
[CLS] gave competitive advantage [SEP] but we found ourselves lagging in the mid '90s in the creature and character design stuff that we had actually founded the company to do. [SEP] effects avatar characters called wrote piece meant absolutely push envelope [SEP]
[CLS] mid found lagging creature character design stuff founded company [SEP] so, i wrote this piece called "avatar," which was meant to absolutely push the envelope of visual effects, of cg effects, beyond, with realistic human emotive characters generated in cg, and the main characters would all be in cg, and the world would be in cg. [SEP] back envelope pushed told folks company [SEP]
[CLS] effects avatar characters called wrote piece meant absolutely push envelope [SEP] and the envelope pushed back, and i was told by the folks at my company that we weren't going to be able to do this for a while. [SEP] sinks shelved made movie big ship [SEP]
[CLS] back envelope pushed told folks company [SEP] so, i shelved it, and i made this other movie about a big ship that sinks. [SEP] romeo juliet ship romance passionate film pitched studio epic [SEP]
[CLS] sinks shelved made movie big ship [SEP] you know, i went and pitched it to the studio as "'romeo and juliet' on a ship:" it's going to be this epic romance, passionate film. " [SEP] wanted secretly titanic dive real wreck [SEP]
[CLS] romeo juliet ship romance passionate film pitched studio epic [SEP] secretly, what i wanted to do was i wanted to dive to the real wreck of "titanic." [SEP] movie made [SEP]
[CLS] wanted secretly titanic dive real wreck [SEP] and that's why i made the movie. [SEP] truth studio [SEP]
[CLS] movie made [SEP] and that's the truth. now, the studio didn't know that. [SEP] convinced wreck real dive film [SEP]
[CLS] truth studio [SEP] but i convinced them. i said, "we're going to dive to the wreck. we're going to film it for real. [SEP] film opening [SEP]
[CLS] convinced wreck real dive film [SEP] we'll be using it in the opening of the film. [SEP] important hook great marketing [SEP]
[CLS] film opening [SEP] it will be really important. it will be a great marketing hook. " [SEP] expedition talked funding [SEP]
[CLS] important hook great marketing [SEP] and i talked them into funding an expedition. [SEP] sounds crazy reality back theme imagination creating [SEP]
[CLS] expedition talked funding [SEP] sounds crazy. but this goes back to that theme about your imagination creating a reality. [SEP] atlantic port created reality months find russian submersible half miles [SEP]
[CLS] sounds crazy reality back theme imagination creating [SEP] because we actually created a reality where six months later, i find myself in a russian submersible two and a half miles down in the north atlantic, looking at the real titanic through a view port. [SEP] movie real [SEP]
[CLS] atlantic port created reality months find russian submersible half miles [SEP] not a movie, not hd -- for real. [SEP] mind blew [SEP]
[CLS] movie real [SEP] now, that blew my mind. [SEP] preparation things lot build cameras lights kinds [SEP]
[CLS] mind blew [SEP] and it took a lot of preparation, we had to build cameras and lights and all kinds of things. [SEP] mission dive dives struck deep space [SEP]
[CLS] preparation things lot build cameras lights kinds [SEP] but, it struck me how much this dive, these deep dives, was like a space mission. [SEP] technical planning highly required enormous [SEP]
[CLS] mission dive dives struck deep space [SEP] you know, where it was highly technical, and it required enormous planning. [SEP] capsule dark hostile environment hope rescue back [SEP]
[CLS] technical planning highly required enormous [SEP] you get in this capsule, you go down to this dark hostile environment where there is no hope of rescue if you can't get back by yourself. [SEP] wow thought living movie science fiction [SEP]
[CLS] capsule dark hostile environment hope rescue back [SEP] and i thought like, "wow. i'm like, living in a science fiction movie. [SEP] cool [SEP]
[CLS] wow thought living movie science fiction [SEP] this is really cool. " [SEP] exploration bitten bug deep-ocean [SEP]
[CLS] cool [SEP] and so, i really got bitten by the bug of deep-ocean exploration. [SEP] curiosity science component adventure imagination [SEP]
[CLS] exploration bitten bug deep-ocean [SEP] of course, the curiosity, the science component of it -- it was everything. it was adventure, it was curiosity, it was imagination. [SEP] experience hollywood give [SEP]
[CLS] curiosity science component adventure imagination [SEP] and it was an experience that hollywood couldn't give me. [SEP] imagine window creature create visual effect [SEP]
[CLS] experience hollywood give [SEP] because, you know, i could imagine a creature and we could create a visual effect for it. but i couldn't imagine what i was seeing out that window. [SEP] things expeditions subsequent creatures hydrothermal vents science time imaged [SEP]
[CLS] imagine window creature create visual effect [SEP] as we did some of our subsequent expeditions, i was seeing creatures at hydrothermal vents and sometimes things that i had never seen before, sometimes things that no one had seen before, that actually were not described by science at the time that we saw them and imaged them. [SEP] completely smitten [SEP]
[CLS] things expeditions subsequent creatures hydrothermal vents science time imaged [SEP] so, i was completely smitten by this, and had to do more. [SEP] decision made kind curious [SEP]
[CLS] completely smitten [SEP] and so, i actually made a kind of curious decision. [SEP] titanic maker success park day job hollywood movie full-time explorer [SEP]
[CLS] decision made kind curious [SEP] after the success of "titanic," i said, "ok, i'm going to park my day job as a hollywood movie maker, and i'm going to go be a full-time explorer for a while." [SEP] bismark vehicles started planning wound exploring robotic [SEP]
[CLS] titanic maker success park day job hollywood movie full-time explorer [SEP] and so, we started planning these and we wound up going to the bismark, and exploring it with robotic vehicles. [SEP] wreck back titanic [SEP]
[CLS] bismark vehicles started planning wound exploring robotic [SEP] we went back to the titanic wreck. [SEP] optic bots created spooled fiber [SEP]
[CLS] wreck back titanic [SEP] we took little bots that we had created that spooled a fiber optic. [SEP] ship idea interior survey [SEP]
[CLS] optic bots created spooled fiber [SEP] and the idea was to go in and do an interior survey of that ship, which had never been done. [SEP] wreck looked inside created technology [SEP]
[CLS] ship idea interior survey [SEP] nobody had ever looked inside the wreck. they didn't have the means to do it, so we created technology to do it. [SEP] titanic sitting submersible played deck planks knew band [SEP]
[CLS] wreck looked inside created technology [SEP] so, you know, here i am now, on the deck of titanic, sitting in a submersible, and looking out at planks that look much like this, where i knew that the band had played. [SEP] ship flying robotic vehicle corridor [SEP]
[CLS] titanic sitting submersible played deck planks knew band [SEP] and i'm flying a little robotic vehicle through the corridor of the ship. [SEP] vehicle operating mind [SEP]
[CLS] ship flying robotic vehicle corridor [SEP] when i say, "i'm operating it," but my mind is in the vehicle. [SEP] titanic felt physically present inside shipwreck [SEP]
[CLS] vehicle operating mind [SEP] i felt like i was physically present inside the shipwreck of titanic. [SEP] movie surreal kind deja experience turned corner lights vehicle revealed [SEP]
[CLS] titanic felt physically present inside shipwreck [SEP] and it was the most surreal kind of deja vu experience i've ever had, because i would know before i turned a corner what was going to be there before the lights of the vehicle actually revealed it, because i had walked the set for months when we were making the movie. [SEP] ship set based exact replica blueprints [SEP]
[CLS] movie surreal kind deja experience turned corner lights vehicle revealed [SEP] and the set was based as an exact replica on the blueprints of the ship. [SEP] experience absolutely remarkable [SEP]
[CLS] ship set based exact replica blueprints [SEP] so, it was this absolutely remarkable experience. [SEP] experience avatars vehicle existence made realize telepresence robotic consciousness injected [SEP]
[CLS] experience absolutely remarkable [SEP] and it really made me realize that the telepresence experience -- that you actually can have these robotic avatars, then your consciousness is injected into the vehicle, into this other form of existence. [SEP] profound [SEP]
[CLS] experience avatars vehicle existence made realize telepresence robotic consciousness injected [SEP] it was really, really quite profound. [SEP] imagine fan bit glimpse happening decades start cyborg bodies exploration [SEP]
[CLS] profound [SEP] and it may be a little bit of a glimpse as to what might be happening some decades out as we start to have cyborg bodies for exploration or for other means in many sort of post-human futures that i can imagine, as a science fiction fan. [SEP] expeditions animals earth amazing beginning deep ocean vents basically aliens [SEP]
[CLS] imagine fan bit glimpse happening decades start cyborg bodies exploration [SEP] so, having done these expeditions, and really beginning to appreciate what was down there, such as at the deep ocean vents where we had these amazing, amazing animals -- they're basically aliens right here on earth. [SEP] chemosynthesis live environment [SEP]
[CLS] expeditions animals earth amazing beginning deep ocean vents basically aliens [SEP] they live in an environment of chemosynthesis. [SEP] survive sunlight-based system [SEP]
[CLS] chemosynthesis live environment [SEP] they don't survive on sunlight-based system the way we do. [SEP] exist animals living possibly [SEP]
[CLS] survive sunlight-based system [SEP] and so, you're seeing animals that are living next to a 500-degree-centigrade you think they can't possibly exist. [SEP] influence kid science time interested space fiction [SEP]
[CLS] exist animals living possibly [SEP] at the same time i was getting very interested in space science as well -- again, it's the science fiction influence, as a kid. [SEP] space involved nasa community sitting board planning missions russia protocols [SEP]
[CLS] influence kid science time interested space fiction [SEP] and i wound up getting involved with the space community, really involved with nasa, sitting on the nasa advisory board, planning actual space missions, going to russia, going through the pre-cosmonaut biomedical protocols, and all these sorts of things, to actually go and fly to the international space station with our 3d camera systems. [SEP] fascinating [SEP]
[CLS] space involved nasa community sitting board planning missions russia protocols [SEP] and this was fascinating. [SEP] deep wound bringing space scientists [SEP]
[CLS] fascinating [SEP] but what i wound up doing was bringing space scientists with us into the deep. [SEP] taking astrobiologists access planetary scientists people environments vents instruments interested [SEP]
[CLS] deep wound bringing space scientists [SEP] and taking them down so that they had access -- astrobiologists, planetary scientists, people who were interested in these extreme environments -- taking them down to the vents, and letting them see, and take samples and test instruments, and so on. [SEP] science films making documentary space [SEP]
[CLS] taking astrobiologists access planetary scientists people environments vents instruments interested [SEP] so, here we were making documentary films, but actually doing science, and actually doing space science. [SEP] fan kid real completely closed loop science fiction stuff [SEP]
[CLS] science films making documentary space [SEP] i'd completely closed the loop between being the science fiction fan, you know, as a kid, and doing this stuff for real. [SEP] discovery lot journey learned [SEP]
[CLS] fan kid real completely closed loop science fiction stuff [SEP] and you know, along the way in this journey of discovery, i learned a lot. [SEP] science learned lot leader captain ship thing director sort [SEP]
[CLS] discovery lot journey learned [SEP] i learned a lot about science. but i also learned a lot now you think director has got to be a leader, leader of, captain of the ship, and all that sort of thing. [SEP] expeditions learn leadership [SEP]
[CLS] science learned lot leader captain ship thing director sort [SEP] i didn't really learn about leadership until i did these expeditions. [SEP] point [SEP]
[CLS] expeditions learn leadership [SEP] because i had to, at a certain point, say, "what am i doing out here? [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] point [SEP] why am i doing this? what do i get out of it? " [SEP] shows make money damn [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] we don't make money at these damn shows. [SEP] barely break fame [SEP]
[CLS] shows make money damn [SEP] we barely break even. there is no fame in it. [SEP] titanic avatar people someplace sitting beach sort buffing nails [SEP]
[CLS] barely break fame [SEP] people sort of think i went away between "titanic" and "avatar" and was buffing my nails someplace, sitting at the beach. [SEP] made audience films documentary limited [SEP]
[CLS] titanic avatar people someplace sitting beach sort buffing nails [SEP] made all these films, made all these documentary films for a very limited audience. [SEP] fame glory money [SEP]
[CLS] made audience films documentary limited [SEP] no fame, no glory, no money. what are you doing? [SEP] challenge discovery team task ocean challenging environment thrill strange bond [SEP]
[CLS] fame glory money [SEP] you're doing it for the task itself, for the challenge -- and the ocean is the most challenging environment there is -- for the thrill of discovery, and for that strange bond that happens when a small group of people form a tightly knit team. [SEP] time people working things years sea months [SEP]
[CLS] challenge discovery team task ocean challenging environment thrill strange bond [SEP] because we would do these things with 10, 12 people, working for years at a time, sometimes at sea for two, three months at a time. [SEP] bond realize important thing respect task explain [SEP]
[CLS] time people working things years sea months [SEP] and in that bond, you realize that the most important thing is the respect that you have for them and that they have for you, that you've done a task that you can't explain to someone else. [SEP] explain people optic attentuation difficulty sea back shore fiber technology [SEP]
[CLS] bond realize important thing respect task explain [SEP] when you come back to the shore and you say, "we had to do this, and the fiber optic, and the attentuation, and the this and the that, all the technology of it, and the difficulty, the human-performance aspects of working at sea," you can't explain it to people. it's that thing that maybe cops have, or people in combat that have gone through something together and they know they can never explain it. [SEP] creates bond respect [SEP]
[CLS] explain people optic attentuation difficulty sea back shore fiber technology [SEP] creates a bond, creates a bond of respect. [SEP] avatar movie leadership team return respect back make apply principle [SEP]
[CLS] creates bond respect [SEP] so, when i came back to make my next movie, which was "avatar," i tried to apply that same principle of leadership, which is that you respect your team, and you earn their respect in return. [SEP] dynamic changed [SEP]
[CLS] avatar movie leadership team return respect back make apply principle [SEP] and it really changed the dynamic. [SEP] avatar team territory coming small uncharted technology exist [SEP]
[CLS] dynamic changed [SEP] so, here i was again with a small team, in uncharted territory, doing "avatar," coming up with new technology that didn't exist before. [SEP] tremendously exciting [SEP]
[CLS] avatar team territory coming small uncharted technology exist [SEP] tremendously exciting. [SEP] tremendously challenging [SEP]
[CLS] tremendously exciting [SEP] tremendously challenging. [SEP] family year period [SEP]
[CLS] tremendously challenging [SEP] and we became a family, over a four-and-half year period. [SEP] movies completely changed [SEP]
[CLS] family year period [SEP] and it completely changed how i do movies. [SEP] people pandora commented brought back ocean organisms put planet [SEP]
[CLS] movies completely changed [SEP] so, people have commented on how, "well, you know, you brought back the ocean organisms and put them on the planet of pandora." [SEP] business fundamental process changed result [SEP]
[CLS] people pandora commented brought back ocean organisms put planet [SEP] to me, it was more of a fundamental way of doing business, the process itself, that changed as a result of that. [SEP] synthesize [SEP]
[CLS] business fundamental process changed result [SEP] so, what can we synthesize out of all this? [SEP] learned lessons [SEP]
[CLS] synthesize [SEP] you know, what are the lessons learned? [SEP] curiosity number [SEP]
[CLS] learned lessons [SEP] well, i think number one is curiosity. [SEP] powerful thing [SEP]
[CLS] curiosity number [SEP] it's the most powerful thing you own. [SEP] imagination reality force manifest [SEP]
[CLS] powerful thing [SEP] imagination is a force that can actually manifest a reality. [SEP] world respect team important laurels [SEP]
[CLS] imagination reality force manifest [SEP] and the respect of your team is more important than all the laurels in the world. [SEP] give young filmmakers advice [SEP]
[CLS] world respect team important laurels [SEP] i have young filmmakers come up to me and say, "give me some advice for doing this." [SEP] put limitations [SEP]
[CLS] give young filmmakers advice [SEP] and i say, "don't put limitations on yourself. [SEP] risks people bet [SEP]
[CLS] put limitations [SEP] other people will do that for you -- don't do it to yourself, don't bet against yourself, and take risks. " [SEP] nasa failure option phrase [SEP]
[CLS] risks people bet [SEP] nasa has this phrase that they like: "failure is not an option." [SEP] exploration faith failure option art leap [SEP]
[CLS] nasa failure option phrase [SEP] but failure has to be an option in art and in exploration, because it's a leap of faith. [SEP] risk important endeavor required innovation [SEP]
[CLS] exploration faith failure option art leap [SEP] and no important endeavor that required innovation was done without risk. [SEP] risks [SEP]
[CLS] risk important endeavor required innovation [SEP] you have to be willing to take those risks. [SEP] failure option thought leave fear [SEP]
[CLS] risks [SEP] so, that's the thought i would leave you with, is that in whatever you're doing, failure is an option, but fear is not. thank you. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] i'm going to talk today about energy and climate. [SEP] seeds bit surprising full-time work foundation vaccines things invent deliver [SEP]
[CLS] climate talk today energy [SEP] and that might seem a bit surprising because my full-time work at the foundation is mostly about vaccines and seeds, about the things that we need to invent and deliver to help the poorest two billion live better lives. [SEP] people fact planet important energy climate extremely [SEP]
[CLS] seeds bit surprising full-time work foundation vaccines things invent deliver [SEP] but energy and climate are extremely important to these people -- in fact, more important than to anyone else on the planet. [SEP] rain years grow things support climate worse crops change fragile [SEP]
[CLS] people fact planet important energy climate extremely [SEP] the climate getting worse means that many years, their crops won't grow: there will be too much rain, not enough rain, things will change in ways that their fragile environment simply can't support. [SEP] leads starvation uncertainty unrest [SEP]
[CLS] rain years grow things support climate worse crops change fragile [SEP] and that leads to starvation, it leads to uncertainty, it leads to unrest. [SEP] climate terrible [SEP]
[CLS] leads starvation uncertainty unrest [SEP] so, the climate changes will be terrible for them. [SEP] price energy important [SEP]
[CLS] climate terrible [SEP] also, the price of energy is very important to them. [SEP] fact poverty energy pick thing lower price reduce [SEP]
[CLS] price energy important [SEP] in fact, if you could pick just one thing to lower the price of, to reduce poverty, by far you would pick energy. [SEP] time price energy [SEP]
[CLS] fact poverty energy pick thing lower price reduce [SEP] now, the price of energy has come down over time. [SEP] energy advanced civilization based advances [SEP]
[CLS] time price energy [SEP] really advanced civilization is based on advances in energy. [SEP] air-conditioning revolution electricity refrigerators things coal fueled industrial rapid decline [SEP]
[CLS] energy advanced civilization based advances [SEP] the coal revolution fueled the industrial revolution, and, even in the 1900s we've seen a very rapid decline in the price of electricity, and that's why we have refrigerators, air-conditioning, we can make modern materials and do so many things. [SEP] world wonderful situation electricity rich [SEP]
[CLS] air-conditioning revolution electricity refrigerators things coal fueled industrial rapid decline [SEP] and so, we're in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world. [SEP] cheaper cheap constraint make making meet [SEP]
[CLS] world wonderful situation electricity rich [SEP] but, as we make it cheaper -- and let's go for making it twice as cheap -- we need to meet a new constraint, and that constraint has to do with co2. [SEP] planet warming equation straightforward [SEP]
[CLS] cheaper cheap constraint make making meet [SEP] co2 is warming the planet, and the equation on co2 is actually a very straightforward one. [SEP] effects leads temperature increase emitted weather worse collapses sum negative [SEP]
[CLS] planet warming equation straightforward [SEP] if you sum up the co2 that gets emitted, that leads to a temperature increase, and that temperature increase leads to some very negative effects: the effects on the weather; perhaps worse, the indirect effects, in that the natural ecosystems can't adjust to these rapid changes, and so you get ecosystem collapses. [SEP] exact amount map increase temperature positive feedbacks uncertainty [SEP]
[CLS] effects leads temperature increase emitted weather worse collapses sum negative [SEP] now, the exact amount of how you map from a certain increase of co2 to what temperature will be and where the positive feedbacks are, there's some uncertainty there, but not very much. [SEP] bad uncertainty effects extremely [SEP]
[CLS] exact amount map increase temperature positive feedbacks uncertainty [SEP] and there's certainly uncertainty about how bad those effects will be, but they will be extremely bad. [SEP] times asked top scientists [SEP]
[CLS] bad uncertainty effects extremely [SEP] i asked the top scientists on this several times: do we really have to get down to near zero? [SEP] quarter cut half [SEP]
[CLS] times asked top scientists [SEP] can't we just cut it in half or a quarter? [SEP] rise answer temperature continue [SEP]
[CLS] quarter cut half [SEP] and the answer is that until we get near to zero, the temperature will continue to rise. [SEP] challenge big [SEP]
[CLS] rise answer temperature continue [SEP] and so that's a big challenge. [SEP] truck bridge ten-foot sort squeeze [SEP]
[CLS] challenge big [SEP] it's very different than saying "we're a twelve-foot-high truck trying to get under a ten-foot bridge, and we can just sort of squeeze under." [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] truck bridge ten-foot sort squeeze [SEP] this is something that has to get to zero. [SEP] year billion tons put lot carbon dioxide [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] now, we put out a lot of carbon dioxide every year, over 26 billion tons. [SEP] american countries tons ton people poor [SEP]
[CLS] year billion tons put lot carbon dioxide [SEP] for each american, it's about 20 tons; for people in poor countries, it's less than one ton. [SEP] planet average tons [SEP]
[CLS] american countries tons ton people poor [SEP] it's an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet. [SEP] make bring [SEP]
[CLS] planet average tons [SEP] and, somehow, we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero. [SEP] constantly [SEP]
[CLS] make bring [SEP] it's been constantly going up. [SEP] falling economic flattened rapidly rising [SEP]
[CLS] constantly [SEP] it's only various economic changes that have even flattened it at all, so we have to go from rapidly rising to falling, and falling all the way to zero. [SEP] average energy factors multiplication left people equation bit thing based [SEP]
[CLS] falling economic flattened rapidly rising [SEP] this equation has four factors, a little bit of multiplication: so, you've got a thing on the left, co2, that you want to get to zero, and that's going to be based on the number of people, the services each person's using on average, the energy on average for each service, and the co2 being put out per unit of energy. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] average energy factors multiplication left people equation bit thing based [SEP] so, let's look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zero. [SEP] numbers pretty [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] probably, one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero. [SEP] algebra back high school [SEP]
[CLS] numbers pretty [SEP] now that's back from high school algebra, but let's take a look. [SEP] population [SEP]
[CLS] algebra back high school [SEP] first, we've got population. [SEP] billion people world today [SEP]
[CLS] population [SEP] the world today has 6.8 billion people. [SEP] billion headed [SEP]
[CLS] billion people world today [SEP] that's headed up to about nine billion. [SEP] percent health vaccines care reproductive services great job lower increase [SEP]
[CLS] billion headed [SEP] now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by, perhaps, 10 or 15 percent, but there we see an increase of about 1.3. [SEP] factor services [SEP]
[CLS] percent health vaccines care reproductive services great job lower increase [SEP] the second factor is the services we use. [SEP] clothing heating eat encompasses food [SEP]
[CLS] factor services [SEP] this encompasses everything: the food we eat, clothing, tv, heating. [SEP] things planet good rid poverty providing services [SEP]
[CLS] clothing heating eat encompasses food [SEP] these are very good things: getting rid of poverty means providing these services to almost everyone on the planet. [SEP] great thing number [SEP]
[CLS] things planet good rid poverty providing services [SEP] and it's a great thing for this number to go up. [SEP] world billion year number average person rich top cut back [SEP]
[CLS] great thing number [SEP] in the rich world, perhaps the top one billion, we probably could cut back and use less, but every year, this number, on average, is going to go up, and so, over all, that will more than double the services delivered per person. [SEP] service homework basic lighting house read [SEP]
[CLS] world billion year number average person rich top cut back [SEP] here we have a very basic service: do you have lighting in your house to be able to read your homework? [SEP] fact lamps kids reading school work street [SEP]
[CLS] service homework basic lighting house read [SEP] and, in fact, these kids don't, so they're going out and reading their school work under the street lamps. [SEP] efficiency service energy finally good [SEP]
[CLS] fact lamps kids reading school work street [SEP] now, efficiency, e, the energy for each service, here finally we have some good news. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] efficiency service energy finally good [SEP] we have something that's not going up. [SEP] percent services bring lighting cars inventions types lot individual building [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] through various inventions and new ways of doing lighting, through different types of cars, different ways of building buildings -- there are a lot of services where you can bring some individual services even bring it down by 90 percent. [SEP] fertilizer transport services make air rooms improvement [SEP]
[CLS] percent services bring lighting cars inventions types lot individual building [SEP] there are other services like how we make fertilizer, or how we do air transport, where the rooms for improvement are far, far less. [SEP] factor optimistic reduction [SEP]
[CLS] fertilizer transport services make air rooms improvement [SEP] and so, overall here, if we're optimistic, we may get a reduction of a factor of three to even, perhaps, a factor of six. [SEP] billion tons factors cut [SEP]
[CLS] factor optimistic reduction [SEP] but for these first three factors now, we've gone from 26 billion to, at best, maybe 13 billion tons, and that just won't cut it. [SEP] factor put energy fourth key amount unit [SEP]
[CLS] billion tons factors cut [SEP] so let's look at this fourth factor -- this is going to be a key one -- and this is the amount of co2 put out per each unit of energy. [SEP] question [SEP]
[CLS] factor put energy fourth key amount unit [SEP] and so the question is: can you actually get that to zero? [SEP] coal burn [SEP]
[CLS] question [SEP] if you burn coal, no. [SEP] gas burn natural [SEP]
[CLS] coal burn [SEP] if you burn natural gas, no. [SEP] today nuclear puts make electricity emerging renewables [SEP]
[CLS] gas burn natural [SEP] almost every way we make electricity today, except for the emerging renewables and nuclear, puts out co2. [SEP] scale system global create [SEP]
[CLS] today nuclear puts make electricity emerging renewables [SEP] and so, what we're going to have to do at a global scale, is create a new system. [SEP] miracles energy [SEP]
[CLS] scale system global create [SEP] and so, we need energy miracles. [SEP] miracle term impossible [SEP]
[CLS] miracles energy [SEP] now, when i use the term "miracle," i don't mean something that's impossible. [SEP] miracle microprocessor personal computer [SEP]
[CLS] miracle term impossible [SEP] the microprocessor is a miracle. the personal computer is a miracle. [SEP] miracle internet services [SEP]
[CLS] miracle microprocessor personal computer [SEP] the internet and its services are a miracle. [SEP] miracles people participated creation [SEP]
[CLS] miracle internet services [SEP] so, the people here have participated in the creation of many miracles. [SEP] deadline date miracle [SEP]
[CLS] miracles people participated creation [SEP] usually, we don't have a deadline, where you have to get the miracle by a certain date. [SEP] kind stand [SEP]
[CLS] deadline date miracle [SEP] usually, you just kind of stand by, and some come along, some don't. [SEP] timeline case drive full speed miracle pretty tight [SEP]
[CLS] kind stand [SEP] this is a case where we actually have to drive at full speed and get a miracle in a pretty tight timeline. [SEP] thought capture [SEP]
[CLS] timeline case drive full speed miracle pretty tight [SEP] now, i thought, "how could i really capture this? [SEP] illustration kind natural demonstration grab people imagination [SEP]
[CLS] thought capture [SEP] is there some kind of natural illustration, some demonstration that would grab people's imagination here? " [SEP] mosquitos thought back year ago brought people enjoyed [SEP]
[CLS] illustration kind natural demonstration grab people imagination [SEP] i thought back to a year ago when i brought mosquitos, and somehow people enjoyed that. [SEP] mosquitos involved idea people live [SEP]
[CLS] mosquitos thought back year ago brought people enjoyed [SEP] it really got them involved in the idea of, you know, there are people who live with mosquitos. [SEP] energy [SEP]
[CLS] mosquitos involved idea people live [SEP] so, with energy, all i could come up with is this. [SEP] year decided releasing fireflies contribution environment [SEP]
[CLS] energy [SEP] i decided that releasing fireflies would be my contribution to the environment here this year. [SEP] fireflies natural [SEP]
[CLS] year decided releasing fireflies contribution environment [SEP] so here we have some natural fireflies. [SEP] bite fact jar told leave [SEP]
[CLS] fireflies natural [SEP] i'm told they don't bite; in fact, they might not even leave that jar. [SEP] sorts gimmicky solutions add [SEP]
[CLS] bite fact jar told leave [SEP] now, there's all sorts of gimmicky solutions like that one, but they don't really add up to much. [SEP] solutions reliability seeking numbers unbelievable scale directions people achieve big [SEP]
[CLS] sorts gimmicky solutions add [SEP] we need solutions -- either one or several -- that have unbelievable scale and unbelievable reliability, and, although there's many directions people are seeking, i really only see five that can achieve the big numbers. [SEP] geothermal fusion biofuels tide left [SEP]
[CLS] solutions reliability seeking numbers unbelievable scale directions people achieve big [SEP] i've left out tide, geothermal, fusion, biofuels. [SEP] contribution expect daunting challenges make key point work give significant [SEP]
[CLS] geothermal fusion biofuels tide left [SEP] those may make some contribution, and if they can do better than i expect, so much the better, but my key point here is that we're going to have to work on each of these five, and we can't give up any of them because they look daunting, because they all have significant challenges. [SEP] burning fuels gas fossil coal natural [SEP]
[CLS] contribution expect daunting challenges make key point work give significant [SEP] let's look first at the burning fossil fuels, either burning coal or burning natural gas. [SEP] simple flue pressurize create liquid put burned hope stays [SEP]
[CLS] burning fuels gas fossil coal natural [SEP] what you need to do there, seems like it might be simple, but it's not, and that's to take all the co2, after you've burned it, going out the flue, pressurize it, create a liquid, put it somewhere, and hope it stays there. [SEP] percent level percentage tricky quantities hard issue pilot things full [SEP]
[CLS] simple flue pressurize create liquid put burned hope stays [SEP] now we have some pilot things that do this at the 60 to 80 percent level, but getting up to that full percentage, that will be very tricky, and agreeing on where these co2 quantities should be put will be hard, but the toughest one here is this long-term issue. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] percent level percentage tricky quantities hard issue pilot things full [SEP] who's going to be sure? [SEP] things guarantee literally billions times larger type waste terms nuclear [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] who's going to guarantee something that is literally billions of times larger than any type of waste you think of in terms of nuclear or other things? [SEP] volume lot [SEP]
[CLS] things guarantee literally billions times larger type waste terms nuclear [SEP] this is a lot of volume. [SEP] tough [SEP]
[CLS] volume lot [SEP] so that's a tough one. [SEP] nuclear [SEP]
[CLS] tough [SEP] next would be nuclear. [SEP] cost problems countries high safety wrong operators weapons big highly [SEP]
[CLS] nuclear [SEP] it also has three big problems: cost, particularly in highly regulated countries, is high; the issue of the safety, really feeling good about nothing could go wrong, that, even though you have these human operators, that the fuel doesn't get used for weapons. [SEP] waste [SEP]
[CLS] cost problems countries high safety wrong operators weapons big highly [SEP] and then what do you do with the waste? [SEP] large lot concerns [SEP]
[CLS] waste [SEP] and, although it's not very large, there are a lot of concerns about that. [SEP] solvable tough problems worked [SEP]
[CLS] large lot concerns [SEP] so three very tough problems that might be solvable, and so, should be worked on. [SEP] grouped [SEP]
[CLS] solvable tough problems worked [SEP] the last three of the five, i've grouped together. [SEP] sources people refer renewable [SEP]
[CLS] grouped [SEP] these are what people often refer to as the renewable sources. [SEP] fuel disadvantages great require [SEP]
[CLS] sources people refer renewable [SEP] and they actually -- although it's great they don't require fuel -- they have some disadvantages. [SEP] plant density energy gathered technologies dramatically power [SEP]
[CLS] fuel disadvantages great require [SEP] one is that the density of energy gathered in these technologies is dramatically less than a power plant. [SEP] farming miles thousands plant energy talking square time area normal [SEP]
[CLS] plant density energy gathered technologies dramatically power [SEP] this is energy farming, so you're talking about many square miles, thousands of time more area than you think of as a normal energy plant. [SEP] sources intermittent [SEP]
[CLS] farming miles thousands plant energy talking square time area normal [SEP] also, these are intermittent sources. [SEP] day likewise shine time sun wind blow [SEP]
[CLS] sources intermittent [SEP] the sun doesn't shine all day, it doesn't shine every day, and, likewise, the wind doesn't blow all the time. [SEP] sources depend energy time periods [SEP]
[CLS] day likewise shine time sun wind blow [SEP] and so, if you depend on these sources, you have to have some way of getting the energy during those time periods that it's not available. [SEP] challenges energy country technology big cost transmission source deal risk [SEP]
[CLS] sources depend energy time periods [SEP] so, we've got big cost challenges here, we have transmission challenges: for example, say this energy source is outside your country; you not only need the technology, but you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from elsewhere. [SEP] finally problem storage [SEP]
[CLS] challenges energy country technology big cost transmission source deal risk [SEP] and, finally, this storage problem. [SEP] batteries energy made cars computers phones flashlights minutes dimensionalize looked [SEP]
[CLS] finally problem storage [SEP] and, to dimensionalize this, i went through and looked at all the types of batteries that get made -- for cars, for computers, for phones, for flashlights, for everything -- and compared that to the amount of electrical energy the world uses, and what i found is that all the batteries we make now could store less than 10 minutes of all the energy. [SEP] fact big breakthrough factor approaches [SEP]
[CLS] batteries energy made cars computers phones flashlights minutes dimensionalize looked [SEP] and so, in fact, we need a big breakthrough here, something that's going to be a factor of 100 better than the approaches we have now. [SEP] impossible thing easy [SEP]
[CLS] fact big breakthrough factor approaches [SEP] it's not impossible, but it's not a very easy thing. [SEP] percent shows intermittent source [SEP]
[CLS] impossible thing easy [SEP] now, this shows up when you try to get the intermittent source to be above, say, 20 to 30 percent of what you're using. [SEP] percent battery counting incredible miracle [SEP]
[CLS] percent shows intermittent source [SEP] if you're counting on it for 100 percent, you need an incredible miracle battery. [SEP] approach forward [SEP]
[CLS] percent battery counting incredible miracle [SEP] now, how we're going to go forward on this -- what's the right approach? [SEP] project manhattan thing [SEP]
[CLS] approach forward [SEP] is it a manhattan project? what's the thing that can get us there? [SEP] hundreds lots companies working [SEP]
[CLS] project manhattan thing [SEP] well, we need lots of companies working on this, hundreds. [SEP] paths people hundred [SEP]
[CLS] hundreds lots companies working [SEP] in each of these five paths, we need at least a hundred people. [SEP] crazy. good lot [SEP]
[CLS] paths people hundred [SEP] and a lot of them, you'll look at and say, "they're crazy." that's good. [SEP] group ted people pursuing [SEP]
[CLS] crazy. good lot [SEP] and, i think, here in the ted group, we have many people who are already pursuing this. [SEP] bill companies including technologies gross called esolar great solar thermal [SEP]
[CLS] group ted people pursuing [SEP] bill gross has several companies, including one called esolar that has some great solar thermal technologies. [SEP] vinod possibilities khosla investing dozens companies great things interesting back [SEP]
[CLS] bill companies including technologies gross called esolar great solar thermal [SEP] vinod khosla's investing in dozens of companies that are doing great things and have interesting possibilities, and i'm trying to help back that. [SEP] nathan surprisingly approach myhrvold backing company taking nuclear [SEP]
[CLS] vinod possibilities khosla investing dozens companies great things interesting back [SEP] nathan myhrvold and i actually are backing a company that, perhaps surprisingly, is actually taking the nuclear approach. [SEP] modular liquid nuclear innovations [SEP]
[CLS] nathan surprisingly approach myhrvold backing company taking nuclear [SEP] there are some innovations in nuclear: modular, liquid. [SEP] ago surprising innovation stopped industry good laying idea ideas [SEP]
[CLS] modular liquid nuclear innovations [SEP] and innovation really stopped in this industry quite some ago, so the idea that there's some good ideas laying around is not all that surprising. [SEP] percent uranium decided idea terrapower burning part burn [SEP]
[CLS] ago surprising innovation stopped industry good laying idea ideas [SEP] the idea of terrapower is that, instead of burning a part of uranium -- the one percent, which is the u235 -- we decided, "let's burn the 99 percent, the u238." [SEP] idea kind crazy [SEP]
[CLS] percent uranium decided idea terrapower burning part burn [SEP] it is kind of a crazy idea. [SEP] work simulate fact people time approach talked long properly advent [SEP]
[CLS] idea kind crazy [SEP] in fact, people had talked about it for a long time, but they could never simulate properly whether it would work or not, and so it's through the advent of modern supercomputers that now you can simulate and see that, yes, with the right material's approach, this looks like it would work. [SEP] percent profile burning greatly improved cost [SEP]
[CLS] work simulate fact people time approach talked long properly advent [SEP] and, because you're burning that 99 percent, you have greatly improved cost profile. [SEP] reactors waste burn fuel leftover today [SEP]
[CLS] percent profile burning greatly improved cost [SEP] you actually burn up the waste, and you can actually use as fuel all the leftover waste from today's reactors. [SEP] worrying thing great [SEP]
[CLS] reactors waste burn fuel leftover today [SEP] so, instead of worrying about them, you just take that. it's a great thing. [SEP] candle breathes uranium kind [SEP]
[CLS] worrying thing great [SEP] it breathes this uranium as it goes along, so it's kind of like a candle. [SEP] reactor log referred traveling wave [SEP]
[CLS] candle breathes uranium kind [SEP] you can see it's a log there, often referred to as a traveling wave reactor. [SEP] fuel problem terms solves [SEP]
[CLS] reactor log referred traveling wave [SEP] in terms of fuel, this really solves the problem. [SEP] kentucky picture place [SEP]
[CLS] fuel problem terms solves [SEP] i've got a picture here of a place in kentucky. [SEP] percent leftover uranium part burn called depleted [SEP]
[CLS] kentucky picture place [SEP] this is the leftover, the 99 percent, where they've taken out the part they burn now, so it's called depleted uranium. [SEP] years power hundreds [SEP]
[CLS] percent leftover uranium part burn called depleted [SEP] that would power the u.s. for hundreds of years. [SEP] simply process planet filtering seawater inexpensive fuel entire lifetime rest [SEP]
[CLS] years power hundreds [SEP] and, simply by filtering seawater in an inexpensive process, you'd have enough fuel for the entire lifetime of the rest of the planet. [SEP] hundreds ahead forward lots challenges ideas move [SEP]
[CLS] simply process planet filtering seawater inexpensive fuel entire lifetime rest [SEP] so, you know, it's got lots of challenges ahead, but it is an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to move forward. [SEP] measure [SEP]
[CLS] hundreds ahead forward lots challenges ideas move [SEP] so let's think: how should we measure ourselves? [SEP] report card [SEP]
[CLS] measure [SEP] what should our report card look like? [SEP] intermediate [SEP]
[CLS] report card [SEP] well, let's go out to where we really need to get, and then look at the intermediate. [SEP] percent reduction heard people talk [SEP]
[CLS] intermediate [SEP] for 2050, you've heard many people talk about this 80 percent reduction. [SEP] important [SEP]
[CLS] percent reduction heard people talk [SEP] that really is very important, that we get there. [SEP] cement percent countries agriculture forestry things poor cleaned [SEP]
[CLS] important [SEP] and that 20 percent will be used up by things going on in poor countries, still some agriculture, hopefully we will have cleaned up forestry, cement. [SEP] percent countries including china altogether developed switch electricity generation [SEP]
[CLS] cement percent countries agriculture forestry things poor cleaned [SEP] so, to get to that 80 percent, the developed countries, including countries like china, will have had to switch their electricity generation altogether. [SEP] technology grade deploying zero-emission deployed developed countries process [SEP]
[CLS] percent countries including china altogether developed switch electricity generation [SEP] so, the other grade is: are we deploying this zero-emission technology, have we deployed it in all the developed countries and we're in the process of getting it elsewhere? [SEP] important super [SEP]
[CLS] technology grade deploying zero-emission deployed developed countries process [SEP] that's super important. [SEP] card key element making report [SEP]
[CLS] important super [SEP] that's a key element of making that report card. [SEP] backing report card [SEP]
[CLS] card key element making report [SEP] so, backing up from there, what should the 2020 report card look like? [SEP] elements [SEP]
[CLS] backing report card [SEP] well, again, it should have the two elements. [SEP] reductions emit temperature efficiency measures start sum [SEP]
[CLS] elements [SEP] we should go through these efficiency measures to start getting reductions: the less we emit, the less that sum will be of co2, and, therefore, the less the temperature. [SEP] reductions equally important breakthroughs grade things big slightly piece innovation [SEP]
[CLS] reductions emit temperature efficiency measures start sum [SEP] but in some ways, the grade we get there, doing things that don't get us all the way to the big reductions, is only equally, or maybe even slightly less, important than the other, which is the piece of innovation on these breakthroughs. [SEP] breakthroughs speed companies pilot projects regulatory changed move full measure [SEP]
[CLS] reductions equally important breakthroughs grade things big slightly piece innovation [SEP] these breakthroughs, we need to move those at full speed, and we can measure that in terms of companies, pilot projects, regulatory things that have been changed. [SEP] lot great books written [SEP]
[CLS] breakthroughs speed companies pilot projects regulatory changed move full measure [SEP] there's a lot of great books that have been written about this. [SEP] book choice sustainable air gore david mckay energy hot [SEP]
[CLS] lot great books written [SEP] the al gore book, "our choice" and the david mckay book, "sustainable energy without the hot air." [SEP] broadly create framework discussed broad backing [SEP]
[CLS] book choice sustainable air gore david mckay energy hot [SEP] they really go through it and create a framework that this can be discussed broadly, because we need broad backing for this. [SEP] lot [SEP]
[CLS] broadly create framework discussed broad backing [SEP] there's a lot that has to come together. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] lot [SEP] so this is a wish. [SEP] technology concrete invent [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] it's a very concrete wish that we invent this technology. [SEP] pick years president vaccine love invented gave thing half cost [SEP]
[CLS] technology concrete invent [SEP] if you gave me only one wish for the next 50 years -- i could pick who's president, i could pick a vaccine, which is something i love, or i could pick that this thing that's half the cost with no co2 gets invented -- this is the wish i would pick. [SEP] impact greatest [SEP]
[CLS] pick years president vaccine love invented gave thing half cost [SEP] this is the one with the greatest impact. [SEP] term terrible china rich worse division people short long poor [SEP]
[CLS] impact greatest [SEP] if we don't get this wish, the division between the people who think short term and long term will be terrible, between the u.s. and china, between poor countries and rich, and most of all the lives of those two billion will be far worse. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] term terrible china rich worse division people short long poor [SEP] so, what do we have to do? [SEP] drive appealing step forward [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] what am i appealing to you to step forward and drive? [SEP] funding research [SEP]
[CLS] drive appealing step forward [SEP] we need to go for more research funding. [SEP] copenhagen countries places discuss [SEP]
[CLS] funding research [SEP] when countries get together in places like copenhagen, they shouldn't just discuss the co2. [SEP] agenda approaches discuss innovation stunned ridiculously low levels spending innovative [SEP]
[CLS] copenhagen countries places discuss [SEP] they should discuss this innovation agenda, and you'd be stunned at the ridiculously low levels of spending on these innovative approaches. [SEP] tax incentives cap trade market price signal [SEP]
[CLS] agenda approaches discuss innovation stunned ridiculously low levels spending innovative [SEP] we do need the market incentives -- co2 tax, cap and trade -- something that gets that price signal out there. [SEP] message [SEP]
[CLS] tax incentives cap trade market price signal [SEP] we need to get the message out. [SEP] rational including dialogue understandable steps government [SEP]
[CLS] message [SEP] we need to have this dialogue be a more rational, more understandable dialogue, including the steps that the government takes. [SEP] achieve important [SEP]
[CLS] rational including dialogue understandable steps government [SEP] this is an important wish, but it is one i think we can achieve. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] achieve important [SEP] thank you. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] thank you. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] thank you. thank you. [SEP] terrapower understand give sense scale investment [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] thank you. so to understand more about terrapower, right -- i mean, first of all, can you give a sense of what scale of investment this is? [SEP] millions materials bil gates software buy supercomputer hire scientists properly [SEP]
[CLS] terrapower understand give sense scale investment [SEP] bil gates: to actually do the software, buy the supercomputer, hire all the great scientists, which we've done, that's only tens of millions, and even once we test our materials out in a russian reactor to make sure that our materials work properly, then you'll only be up in the hundreds of millions. [SEP] finding reactor billion regulator tough thing building pilot location build [SEP]
[CLS] millions materials bil gates software buy supercomputer hire scientists properly [SEP] the tough thing is building the pilot reactor; finding the several billion, finding the regulator, the location that will actually build the first one of these. [SEP] built advertised day economics density works clear energy nuclear [SEP]
[CLS] finding reactor billion regulator tough thing building pilot location build [SEP] once you get the first one built, if it works as advertised, then it's just clear as day, because the economics, the energy density, are so different than nuclear as we know it. [SEP] kind fuel uranium understand involves building deep ground vertical column [SEP]
[CLS] built advertised day economics density works clear energy nuclear [SEP] and so, to understand it right, this involves building deep into the ground almost like a vertical kind of column of nuclear fuel, of this sort of spent uranium, and then the process starts at the top and kind of works down? [SEP] lots today reactor wrong good refueling people controls opening moving [SEP]
[CLS] kind fuel uranium understand involves building deep ground vertical column [SEP] bg: that's right. today, you're always refueling the reactor, so you have lots of people and lots of controls that can go wrong: that thing where you're opening it up and moving things in and out, that's not good. [SEP] years log complexities put cheap fuel [SEP]
[CLS] lots today reactor wrong good refueling people controls opening moving [SEP] so, if you have very cheap fuel that you can put 60 years in -- just think of it as a log -- put it down and not have those same complexities. [SEP] years sits burns [SEP]
[CLS] years log complexities put cheap fuel [SEP] and it just sits there and burns for the 60 years, and then it's done. [SEP] solution nuclear power plant waste disposal [SEP]
[CLS] years sits burns [SEP] it's a nuclear power plant that is its own waste disposal solution. [SEP] yeah waste approach sit lot put burn [SEP]
[CLS] solution nuclear power plant waste disposal [SEP] bg: yeah. well, what happens with the waste, you can let it sit there -- there's a lot less waste under this approach -- then you can actually take that, and put it into another one and burn that. [SEP] today reactors start taking waste exists sitting cooling pools dry [SEP]
[CLS] yeah waste approach sit lot put burn [SEP] and we start off actually by taking the waste that exists today, that's sitting in these cooling pools or dry casking by reactors -- that's our fuel to begin with. [SEP] process thing problem reactors fed reducing volume waste dramatically [SEP]
[CLS] today reactors start taking waste exists sitting cooling pools dry [SEP] so, the thing that's been a problem from those reactors is actually what gets fed into ours, and you're reducing the volume of the waste quite dramatically as you're going through this process. [SEP] talking people world possibilities [SEP]
[CLS] process thing problem reactors fed reducing volume waste dramatically [SEP] i mean, you're talking to different people around the world about the possibilities here. [SEP] interest [SEP]
[CLS] talking people world possibilities [SEP] where is there most interest in actually doing something with this? [SEP] nuclear india china energy place called interest russia talking agenda [SEP]
[CLS] interest [SEP] bg: well, we haven't picked a particular place, and there's all these interesting disclosure rules about anything that's called "nuclear," so we've got a lot of interest, that people from the company have been in russia, india, china -- i've been back seeing the secretary of energy here, talking about how this fits into the energy agenda. [SEP] optimistic work french japanese [SEP]
[CLS] nuclear india china energy place called interest russia talking agenda [SEP] so i'm optimistic. you know, the french and japanese have done some work. [SEP] variant [SEP]
[CLS] optimistic work french japanese [SEP] this is a variant on something that has been done. [SEP] fast reactor built advance important lot countries candidate [SEP]
[CLS] variant [SEP] it's an important advance, but it's like a fast reactor, and a lot of countries have built them, so anybody who's done a fast reactor is a candidate to be where the first one gets built. [SEP] mind timescale live likelihood taking [SEP]
[CLS] fast reactor built advance important lot countries candidate [SEP] so, in your mind, timescale and likelihood of actually taking something like this live? [SEP] years high-scale electro-generation cheap deploy things invent [SEP]
[CLS] mind timescale live likelihood taking [SEP] bg: well, we need -- for one of these high-scale, electro-generation things that's very cheap, we have 20 years to invent and then 20 years to deploy. [SEP] meet sort deadline environmental models shown [SEP]
[CLS] years high-scale electro-generation cheap deploy things invent [SEP] that's sort of the deadline that the environmental models have shown us that we have to meet. [SEP] terrapower lot things wishing easily meet [SEP]
[CLS] meet sort deadline environmental models shown [SEP] and, you know, terrapower, if things go well -- which is wishing for a lot -- could easily meet that. [SEP] likewise fortunately dozens companies hundreds science funding pilot plants compete [SEP]
[CLS] terrapower lot things wishing easily meet [SEP] and there are, fortunately now, dozens of companies -- we need it to be hundreds -- who, likewise, if their science goes well, if the funding for their pilot plants goes well, that they can compete for this. [SEP] succeed things multiple mix [SEP]
[CLS] likewise fortunately dozens companies hundreds science funding pilot plants compete [SEP] and it's best if multiple succeed, because then you could use a mix of these things. [SEP] succeed [SEP]
[CLS] succeed things multiple mix [SEP] we certainly need one to succeed. [SEP] terms big-scale game biggest aware [SEP]
[CLS] succeed [SEP] in terms of big-scale possible game changes, is this the biggest that you're aware of out there? [SEP] thing energy breakthrough important [SEP]
[CLS] terms big-scale game biggest aware [SEP] bg: an energy breakthrough is the most important thing. [SEP] environmental constraint greater makes [SEP]
[CLS] thing energy breakthrough important [SEP] it would have been, even without the environmental constraint, but the environmental constraint just makes it so much greater. [SEP] space innovators nuclear [SEP]
[CLS] environmental constraint greater makes [SEP] in the nuclear space, there are other innovators. [SEP] people approach work modular [SEP]
[CLS] space innovators nuclear [SEP] you know, we don't know their work as well as we know this one, but the modular people, that's a different approach. [SEP] reactor hard liquid-type [SEP]
[CLS] people approach work modular [SEP] there's a liquid-type reactor, which seems a little hard, but maybe they say that about us. [SEP] molecule coal negatives radiation cost potential things beauty uranium million [SEP]
[CLS] reactor hard liquid-type [SEP] and so, there are different ones, but the beauty of this is a molecule of uranium has a million times as much energy as a molecule of, say, coal, and so -- if you can deal with the negatives, which are essentially the radiation -- the footprint and cost, the potential, in terms of effect on land and various things, is almost in a class of its own. [SEP] work [SEP]
[CLS] molecule coal negatives radiation cost potential things beauty uranium million [SEP] if this doesn't work, then what? [SEP] stable start taking emergency measures temperature earth [SEP]
[CLS] work [SEP] do we have to start taking emergency measures to try and keep the temperature of the earth stable? [SEP] situation over-eating attack heart surgery [SEP]
[CLS] stable start taking emergency measures temperature earth [SEP] bg: if you get into that situation, it's like if you've been over-eating, and you're about to have a heart attack: then where do you go? you may need heart surgery or something. [SEP] geoengineering years line research called techniques delay heating buy act [SEP]
[CLS] situation over-eating attack heart surgery [SEP] there is a line of research on what's called geoengineering, which are various techniques that would delay the heating to buy us 20 or 30 years to get our act together. [SEP] policy insurance [SEP]
[CLS] geoengineering years line research called techniques delay heating buy act [SEP] now, that's just an insurance policy. [SEP] hope [SEP]
[CLS] policy insurance [SEP] you hope you don't need to do that. [SEP] lazy people work insurance policy make eating heart surgery save [SEP]
[CLS] hope [SEP] some people say you shouldn't even work on the insurance policy because it might make you lazy, that you'll keep eating because you know heart surgery will be there to save you. [SEP] wise problem faster expect importance geoengineering discussion back pocket case [SEP]
[CLS] lazy people work insurance policy make eating heart surgery save [SEP] i'm not sure that's wise, given the importance of the problem, but there's now the geoengineering discussion about -- should that be in the back pocket in case things happen faster, or this innovation goes a lot slower than we expect? [SEP] climate skeptics wrong sentence persuade [SEP]
[CLS] wise problem faster expect importance geoengineering discussion back pocket case [SEP] climate skeptics: if you had a sentence or two to say to them, how might you persuade them that they're wrong? [SEP] camps skeptics [SEP]
[CLS] climate skeptics wrong sentence persuade [SEP] bg: well, unfortunately, the skeptics come in different camps. [SEP] make scientific arguments [SEP]
[CLS] camps skeptics [SEP] the ones who make scientific arguments are very few. [SEP] things negative feedback effects clouds offset [SEP]
[CLS] make scientific arguments [SEP] are they saying that there's negative feedback effects that have to do with clouds that offset things? [SEP] things chance million [SEP]
[CLS] things negative feedback effects clouds offset [SEP] there are very, very few things that they can even say there's a chance in a million of those things. [SEP] aids main problem kind [SEP]
[CLS] things chance million [SEP] the main problem we have here, it's kind of like aids. [SEP] make mistake pay lot [SEP]
[CLS] aids main problem kind [SEP] you make the mistake now, and you pay for it a lot later. [SEP] pain ipcc problems thing fact report case deal sorts urgent [SEP]
[CLS] make mistake pay lot [SEP] and so, when you have all sorts of urgent problems, the idea of taking pain now that has to do with a gain later, and a somewhat uncertain pain thing -- in fact, the ipcc report, that's not necessarily the worst case, and there are people in the rich world who look at ipcc and say, "ok, that isn't that big of a deal." [SEP] fact uncertain part move [SEP]
[CLS] pain ipcc problems thing fact report case deal sorts urgent [SEP] the fact is it's that uncertain part that should move us towards this. [SEP] put constraints economic dream make meet skeptics care kind guess [SEP]
[CLS] fact uncertain part move [SEP] but my dream here is that, if you can make it economic, and meet the co2 constraints, then the skeptics say, "ok, i don't care that it doesn't put out co2, i kind of wish it did put out co2, but i guess i'll accept it because it's cheaper than what's come before." [SEP] problem argument response bjorn lomborg basically spend energy solve goals [SEP]
[CLS] put constraints economic dream make meet skeptics care kind guess [SEP] and so, that would be your response to the bjorn lomborg argument, that basically if you spend all this energy trying to solve the co2 problem, it's going to take away all your other goals of trying to rid the world of poverty and malaria and so forth, it's a stupid waste of the earth's resources to put money towards that when there are better things we can do. [SEP] amp piece spend billion dramatic actual spending year [SEP]
[CLS] problem argument response bjorn lomborg basically spend energy solve goals [SEP] bg: well, the actual spending on the r & amp; d piece -- say the u.s. should spend 10 billion a year more than it is right now -- it's not that dramatic. [SEP] things [SEP]
[CLS] amp piece spend billion dramatic actual spending year [SEP] it shouldn't take away from other things. [SEP] reasonable disagree waste thing big money people non-economic fund [SEP]
[CLS] things [SEP] the thing you get into big money on, and this, reasonable people can disagree, is when you have something that's non-economic and you're trying to fund that -- that, to me, mostly is a waste. [SEP] cheap expensive close funding learning curve things potential [SEP]
[CLS] reasonable disagree waste thing big money people non-economic fund [SEP] unless you're very close and you're just funding the learning curve and it's going to get very cheap, i believe we should try more things that have a potential to be far less expensive. [SEP] expensive trade-off make energy super rich afford [SEP]
[CLS] cheap expensive close funding learning curve things potential [SEP] if the trade-off you get into is, "let's make energy super expensive," then the rich can afford that. [SEP] lifestyle pay times energy change [SEP]
[CLS] expensive trade-off make energy super rich afford [SEP] i mean, all of us here could pay five times as much for our energy and not change our lifestyle. [SEP] billion disaster [SEP]
[CLS] lifestyle pay times energy change [SEP] the disaster is for that two billion. [SEP] changed lomborg [SEP]
[CLS] billion disaster [SEP] and even lomborg has changed. [SEP] amp discussed shtick [SEP]
[CLS] changed lomborg [SEP] his shtick now is, "why isn't the r & amp; d getting more discussed?" [SEP] camp amp stuff point earlier skeptic realized pretty lonely making [SEP]
[CLS] amp discussed shtick [SEP] he's still, because of his earlier stuff, still associated with the skeptic camp, but he's realized that's a pretty lonely camp, and so, he's making the r & amp; d point. [SEP] thread [SEP]
[CLS] camp amp stuff point earlier skeptic realized pretty lonely making [SEP] and so there is a thread of something that i think is appropriate. [SEP] amp piece funded crazy [SEP]
[CLS] thread [SEP] the r & amp; d piece, it's crazy how little it's funded. [SEP] bill true suspect speak behalf people hope [SEP]
[CLS] amp piece funded crazy [SEP] well bill, i suspect i speak on the behalf of most people here to say i really hope your wish comes true. thank you so much. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] bill true suspect speak behalf people hope [SEP] bg: thank you. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] several years ago here at ted, peter skillman introduced a design challenge called the marshmallow challenge. [SEP] yard simple teams sticks spaghetti tape marshmallow idea pretty build [SEP]
[CLS] ted peter challenge years ago skillman introduced design called marshmallow [SEP] and the idea's pretty simple: teams of four have to build the tallest free-standing structure out of 20 sticks of spaghetti, one yard of tape, one yard of string and a marshmallow. [SEP] top marshmallow [SEP]
[CLS] yard simple teams sticks spaghetti tape marshmallow idea pretty build [SEP] the marshmallow has to be on top. [SEP] simple quickly pretty hard forces people collaborate [SEP]
[CLS] top marshmallow [SEP] and, though it seems really simple, it's actually pretty hard because it forces people to collaborate very quickly. [SEP] idea workshop thought interesting incorporated design [SEP]
[CLS] simple quickly pretty hard forces people collaborate [SEP] and so, i thought this was an interesting idea, and i incorporated it into a design workshop. [SEP] success huge [SEP]
[CLS] idea workshop thought interesting incorporated design [SEP] and it was a huge success. [SEP] design architects fortune collaboration conducted workshops world students designers ctos [SEP]
[CLS] success huge [SEP] and since then, i've conducted about 70 design workshops across the world with students and designers and architects, even the ctos of the fortune 50, and there's something about this exercise that reveals very deep lessons about the nature of collaboration, and i'd like to share some of them with you. [SEP] task people begin orienting [SEP]
[CLS] design architects fortune collaboration conducted workshops world students designers ctos [SEP] so, normally, most people begin by orienting themselves to the task. [SEP] power talk figure jockey [SEP]
[CLS] task people begin orienting [SEP] they talk about it, they figure out what it's going to look like, they jockey for power. [SEP] organizing planning spaghetti spend time sketch lay [SEP]
[CLS] power talk figure jockey [SEP] then they spend some time planning, organizing, they sketch and they lay out spaghetti. [SEP] structures spend majority time assembling sticks ever-growing [SEP]
[CLS] organizing planning spaghetti spend time sketch lay [SEP] they spend the majority of their time assembling the sticks into ever-growing structures. [SEP] ta-da finally time marshmallow top back running gingerly put stand [SEP]
[CLS] structures spend majority time assembling sticks ever-growing [SEP] and then finally, just as they're running out of time, someone takes out the marshmallow, and then they gingerly put it on top, and then they stand back, and -- ta-da! -- they admire their work. [SEP] ta-da uh-oh time turns collapse weight marshmallow entire structure buckle [SEP]
[CLS] ta-da finally time marshmallow top back running gingerly put stand [SEP] but what really happens, most of the time, is that the "ta-da" turns into an "uh-oh," because the weight of the marshmallow causes the entire structure to buckle and to collapse. [SEP] uh-oh moments school number people lot worst recent graduates business [SEP]
[CLS] ta-da uh-oh time turns collapse weight marshmallow entire structure buckle [SEP] so there are a number of people who have a lot more "uh-oh" moments than others, and among the worst are recent graduates of business school. [SEP] lie cheat structures distracted produce lame [SEP]
[CLS] uh-oh moments school number people lot worst recent graduates business [SEP] they lie, they cheat, they get distracted and they produce really lame structures. [SEP] ta-da structures kindergarten teams lot recent graduates [SEP]
[CLS] lie cheat structures distracted produce lame [SEP] and of course there are teams that have a lot more "ta-da" structures, and among the best are recent graduates of kindergarten. [SEP] amazing pretty [SEP]
[CLS] ta-da structures kindergarten teams lot recent graduates [SEP] and it's pretty amazing. [SEP] structures peter produce tallest interesting [SEP]
[CLS] amazing pretty [SEP] as peter tells us, not only do they produce the tallest structures, but they're the most interesting structures of them all. [SEP] question [SEP]
[CLS] structures peter produce tallest interesting [SEP] so the question you want to ask is: how come? why? what is it about them? [SEP] spaghetti peter kids spend time ceo [SEP]
[CLS] question [SEP] and peter likes to say that none of the kids spend any time trying to be ceo of spaghetti, inc. right? [SEP] power spend time jockeying [SEP]
[CLS] spaghetti peter kids spend time ceo [SEP] they don't spend time jockeying for power. [SEP] reason [SEP]
[CLS] power spend time jockeying [SEP] but there's another reason as well. [SEP] plan reason business students trained find single [SEP]
[CLS] reason [SEP] and the reason is that business students are trained to find the single right plan, right? [SEP] execute [SEP]
[CLS] plan reason business students trained find single [SEP] and then they execute on it. [SEP] top put marshmallow run time [SEP]
[CLS] execute [SEP] and then what happens is, when they put the marshmallow on the top, they run out of time and what happens? [SEP] crisis [SEP]
[CLS] top put marshmallow run time [SEP] it's a crisis. [SEP] sound familiar [SEP]
[CLS] crisis [SEP] sound familiar? right. [SEP] build prototypes marshmallow successive top kindergarteners differently start keeping multiple [SEP]
[CLS] sound familiar [SEP] what kindergarteners do differently is that they start with the marshmallow, and they build prototypes, successive prototypes, always keeping the marshmallow on top, so they have multiple times to fix when they build prototypes along the way. [SEP] designers process recognize type collaboration essence iterative [SEP]
[CLS] build prototypes marshmallow successive top kindergarteners differently start keeping multiple [SEP] designers recognize this type of collaboration as the essence of the iterative process. [SEP] version kids instant feedback works work [SEP]
[CLS] designers process recognize type collaboration essence iterative [SEP] and with each version, kids get instant feedback about what works and what doesn't work. [SEP] essential perform capacity play prototype teams [SEP]
[CLS] version kids instant feedback works work [SEP] so the capacity to play in prototype is really essential, but let's look at how different teams perform. [SEP] inches lawyers kindergarteners business students adults average people schools half [SEP]
[CLS] essential perform capacity play prototype teams [SEP] so the average for most people is around 20 inches; business schools students, about half of that; lawyers, a little better, but not much better than that, kindergarteners, better than most adults. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] inches lawyers kindergarteners business students adults average people schools half [SEP] who does the very best? [SEP] thankfully architects engineers [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] architects and engineers, thankfully. [SEP] thirty-nine inches tallest structure [SEP]
[CLS] thankfully architects engineers [SEP] thirty-nine inches is the tallest structure i've seen. [SEP] structures understand triangles self-reinforcing geometrical patterns key building stable [SEP]
[CLS] thirty-nine inches tallest structure [SEP] and why is it? because they understand triangles and self-reinforcing geometrical patterns are the key to building stable structures. [SEP] ceos average interesting bit [SEP]
[CLS] structures understand triangles self-reinforcing geometrical patterns key building stable [SEP] so ceos, a little bit better than average, but here's where it gets interesting. [SEP] put admin executive team significantly [SEP]
[CLS] ceos average interesting bit [SEP] if you put you put an executive admin. on the team, they get significantly better. [SEP] incredible win team [SEP]
[CLS] put admin executive team significantly [SEP] it's incredible. you know, you look around, you go, "oh, that team's going to win." [SEP] beforehand. [SEP]
[CLS] incredible win team [SEP] you can just tell beforehand. and why is that? [SEP] facilitation special skills [SEP]
[CLS] beforehand. [SEP] because they have special skills of facilitation. [SEP] process manage understand [SEP]
[CLS] facilitation special skills [SEP] they manage the process, they understand the process. [SEP] performance team manages pays close attention work significantly improve [SEP]
[CLS] process manage understand [SEP] and any team who manages and pays close attention to work will significantly improve the team's performance. [SEP] specialized success skills facilitation combination leads strong [SEP]
[CLS] performance team manages pays close attention work significantly improve [SEP] specialized skills and facilitation skills are the combination that leads to strong success. [SEP] teams perform structures typically standing [SEP]
[CLS] specialized success skills facilitation combination leads strong [SEP] if you have 10 teams that typically perform, you'll get maybe six or so that have standing structures. [SEP] interesting [SEP]
[CLS] teams perform structures typically standing [SEP] and i tried something interesting. [SEP] thought ante [SEP]
[CLS] interesting [SEP] i thought, let's up the ante, once. [SEP] dollar team offered prize software winning [SEP]
[CLS] thought ante [SEP] so i offered a 10,000 dollar prize of software to the winning team. [SEP] students happened design [SEP]
[CLS] dollar team offered prize software winning [SEP] so what do you think happened to these design students? [SEP] result [SEP]
[CLS] students happened design [SEP] what was the result? [SEP] happened structure team standing [SEP]
[CLS] result [SEP] here's what happened: not one team had a standing structure. [SEP] built structure prize inch home [SEP]
[CLS] happened structure team standing [SEP] if anyone had built, say, a one inch structure, they would have taken home the prize. [SEP] interesting impact high stakes strong [SEP]
[CLS] built structure prize inch home [SEP] so, isn't that interesting? that high stakes have a strong impact. [SEP] students exercise [SEP]
[CLS] interesting impact high stakes strong [SEP] we did the exercise again with the same students. [SEP] happened [SEP]
[CLS] students exercise [SEP] what do you think happened then? [SEP] prototyping understand [SEP]
[CLS] happened [SEP] so now they understand the value of prototyping. [SEP] team worst [SEP]
[CLS] prototyping understand [SEP] so the same team went from being the very worst to being among the very best. [SEP] time produced tallest structures amount [SEP]
[CLS] team worst [SEP] they produced the tallest structures in the least amount of time. [SEP] success deep lessons nature incentives [SEP]
[CLS] time produced tallest structures amount [SEP] so there's deep lessons for us about the nature of incentives and success. [SEP] challenge spend time writing marshmallow [SEP]
[CLS] success deep lessons nature incentives [SEP] so, you might ask: why would anyone actually spend time writing a marshmallow challenge? [SEP] effects reason create digital tools processes teams build cars video [SEP]
[CLS] challenge spend time writing marshmallow [SEP] and the reason is, i help create digital tools and processes to help teams build cars and video games and visual effects. [SEP] assumptions marshmallow challenge identify hidden [SEP]
[CLS] effects reason create digital tools processes teams build cars video [SEP] and what the marshmallow challenge does is it helps them identify the hidden assumptions. [SEP] frankly marshmallow project [SEP]
[CLS] assumptions marshmallow challenge identify hidden [SEP] because, frankly, every project has its own marshmallow, doesn't it? [SEP] common experience language prototype challenge shared stance build [SEP]
[CLS] frankly marshmallow project [SEP] the challenge provides a shared experience, a common language, a common stance to build the right prototype. [SEP] experience exercise simple [SEP]
[CLS] common experience language prototype challenge shared stance build [SEP] and so, this is the value of the experience, of this so simple exercise. [SEP] marshmallowchallenge.com interested [SEP]

[CLS] genetically food engineered [SEP] we don't want to encourage people to eat that rotten stuff, like cassava for instance. [SEP] cassava eat half billion people [SEP]
[CLS] stuff instance encourage people eat rotten cassava [SEP] cassava's something that half a billion people eat. [SEP] potato kind [SEP]
[CLS] cassava eat half billion people [SEP] it's kind of like a potato. [SEP] calories bunch sucks [SEP]
[CLS] potato kind [SEP] it's just a bunch of calories. it sucks. [SEP] nutrients protein scientists engineering [SEP]
[CLS] calories bunch sucks [SEP] it doesn't have nutrients, it doesn't have protein, and scientists are engineering all of that into it right now. [SEP] blind people eat [SEP]
[CLS] nutrients protein scientists engineering [SEP] and then people would be able to eat it and they'd be able to not go blind. [SEP] starve [SEP]
[CLS] blind people eat [SEP] they wouldn't starve, and you know what? [SEP] nice panisse chez [SEP]
[CLS] starve [SEP] that would be nice. it wouldn't be chez panisse, but it would be nice. [SEP] fighting [SEP]
[CLS] nice panisse chez [SEP] and all i can say about this is: why are we fighting it? [SEP] fighting [SEP]
[CLS] fighting [SEP] i mean, let's ask ourselves: why are we fighting it? [SEP] move genes [SEP]
[CLS] fighting [SEP] because we don't want to move genes around? [SEP] moving genes chemicals [SEP]
[CLS] move genes [SEP] this is about moving genes around. it's not about chemicals. [SEP] food hormones singular ridiculous passion insistence bigger [SEP]
[CLS] moving genes chemicals [SEP] it's not about our ridiculous passion for hormones, our insistence on having bigger food, better food, singular food. [SEP] krispies alive meant rice keeping people time started understand [SEP]
[CLS] food hormones singular ridiculous passion insistence bigger [SEP] this isn't about rice krispies, this is about keeping people alive, and it's about time we started to understand what that meant. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] krispies alive meant rice keeping people time started understand [SEP] because, you know something? [SEP] guilty acting high-tech colonialism continue act [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] if we don't, if we continue to act the way we're acting, we're guilty of something that i don't think we want to be guilty of: high-tech colonialism. [SEP] describe [SEP]
[CLS] guilty acting high-tech colonialism continue act [SEP] there's no other way to describe what's going on here. [SEP] selfish ugly beneath stop [SEP]
[CLS] describe [SEP] it's selfish, it's ugly, it's beneath us, and we really have to stop it. [SEP] conversation forward amazingly fun ridiculous time machine [SEP]
[CLS] selfish ugly beneath stop [SEP] so after this amazingly fun conversation, you might want to say, "so, you still want to get in this ridiculous time machine and go forward?" [SEP] absolutely [SEP]
[CLS] conversation forward amazingly fun ridiculous time machine [SEP] absolutely. absolutely, i do. [SEP] opportunity stuck present amazing [SEP]

[CLS]  [SEP] thank you. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] for some time i have been interested in the placebo effect, which might seem like an odd thing for a magician to be interested in, unless you think of it in the terms that i do, which is, "something fake is believed in enough by somebody that it becomes something real." [SEP] effect measurable placebo words sugar studies management pills kinds person [SEP]
[CLS] interested effect real time placebo odd thing magician terms fake [SEP] in other words, sugar pills have a measurable effect in certain kinds of studies, the placebo effect, just because the person thinks that what's happening to them is a pharmaceutical or some sort of a -- for pain management, for example, if they believe it enough there is a measurable effect in the body called the placebo effect. [SEP] fake real perception [SEP]
[CLS] effect measurable placebo words sugar studies management pills kinds person [SEP] something fake becomes something real because of someone's perception of it. [SEP] rudimentary trick order understand start showing simple magic [SEP]
[CLS] fake real perception [SEP] in order for us to understand each other, i want to start by showing you a rudimentary, very simple magic trick. [SEP] works show trick children magic book [SEP]
[CLS] rudimentary trick order understand start showing simple magic [SEP] and i'm going to show you how it works. this is a trick that's been in every children's magic book since at least the 1950s. [SEP] learned cub scout magic [SEP]
[CLS] works show trick children magic book [SEP] i learned it myself from cub scout magic in the 1970s. [SEP] explain [SEP]
[CLS] learned cub scout magic [SEP] i'll do it for you, and then i'll explain it. [SEP] explain explained [SEP]
[CLS] explain [SEP] and then i'll explain why i explained it. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] explain explained [SEP] so, here's what happens. [SEP] examine knife hand [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] the knife, which you can examine; my hand, which you could examine. [SEP] hold knife fist [SEP]
[CLS] examine knife hand [SEP] i'm just going to hold the knife in my fist like this. [SEP] back sleeve [SEP]
[CLS] hold knife fist [SEP] i'll get my sleeve back. [SEP] make sleeve squeeze wrist [SEP]
[CLS] back sleeve [SEP] and to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve i'm just going to squeeze my wrist right here. [SEP] travel sleeve time long squeezing [SEP]
[CLS] make sleeve squeeze wrist [SEP] that way you can see that at no time can anything travel, as long as i'm squeezing there nothing can go up or down my sleeve. [SEP] simple object [SEP]
[CLS] travel sleeve time long squeezing [SEP] and the object of this is quite simple. [SEP] hand knife open pure animal magnetism hold [SEP]
[CLS] simple object [SEP] i'm going to open my hand, and hopefully, if all is well, my pure animal magnetism will hold the knife. [SEP] fact held tightly place shake knife [SEP]
[CLS] hand knife open pure animal magnetism hold [SEP] in fact it's held so tightly in place that i can shake it, and the knife does not come off. [SEP] sleeve trickery. examine [SEP]
[CLS] fact held tightly place shake knife [SEP] nothing goes up or down my sleeve, no trickery. and you can examine everything. [SEP] ta-da [SEP]
[CLS] sleeve trickery. examine [SEP] ta-da! [SEP] trick magic methodologically teach young children interested learn great deal [SEP]
[CLS] ta-da [SEP] so, this is a trick that i often teach to young children that are interested in magic, because you can learn a great deal about deception by studying this very -- even though it's a very simple trick methodologically. [SEP] trick room [SEP]
[CLS] trick magic methodologically teach young children interested learn great deal [SEP] probably many of you in the room know this trick. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] trick room [SEP] what happens is this. [SEP] hand hold knife [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] i hold the knife in my hand. [SEP] sleeve lie grab hold wrist make [SEP]
[CLS] hand hold knife [SEP] i say i'm going to grab hold of my wrist to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve, that is a lie. [SEP] illusion reason holding wrist secret [SEP]
[CLS] sleeve lie grab hold wrist make [SEP] the reason i'm holding onto my wrist is because that's actually the secret of the illusion. [SEP] finger moment hand moves facing index shift position pointing [SEP]
[CLS] illusion reason holding wrist secret [SEP] in a moment when my hand moves from facing you to being away from you, this finger right here, my index finger is just going to shift from where it is, to a position pointing out like this. [SEP] nice [SEP]
[CLS] finger moment hand moves facing index shift position pointing [SEP] nice one. [SEP] childhood [SEP]
[CLS] nice [SEP] someone who didn't have a childhood is out there. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] childhood [SEP] so, it goes like this, from here, right. [SEP] shifts move finger [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] and as i move around my finger shifts. [SEP] deceptive mind information count talk notice fingers processes groups [SEP]
[CLS] shifts move finger [SEP] and we could talk about why this is deceptive, why you don't notice there are only three fingers down here, because the mind, and the way it processes information, it doesn't count, one, two, three. it groups them. [SEP] about. open hand [SEP]
[CLS] deceptive mind information count talk notice fingers processes groups [SEP] but that's not really what this is about. right? and then i open my hand up. [SEP] magnetism chicanery clinging animal index finger [SEP]
[CLS] about. open hand [SEP] obviously it's clinging there, not by animal magnetism, but by chicanery, my index finger being there. [SEP] finger thing back close move motion kind covers moving [SEP]
[CLS] magnetism chicanery clinging animal index finger [SEP] and then when i close my finger, same thing, as i move back, this motion kind of covers the moving back of my finger. [SEP] hand give knife [SEP]
[CLS] finger thing back close move motion kind covers moving [SEP] i take this hand away. you give the knife out. [SEP] neighbors trick friends [SEP]
[CLS] hand give knife [SEP] there is a trick you can do for your friends and neighbors. thanks. [SEP] effect placebo [SEP]
[CLS] neighbors trick friends [SEP] now, what does that have to do with the placebo effect? [SEP] open read study year ago blew mind wide [SEP]
[CLS] effect placebo [SEP] i read a study a year or so ago that really blew my mind wide open. [SEP] researcher thing doctor astonishing [SEP]
[CLS] open read study year ago blew mind wide [SEP] i'm not a doctor or a researcher, so this, to me, was an astonishing thing. [SEP] pill white shaped effect turns administer placebo form aspirin round [SEP]
[CLS] researcher thing doctor astonishing [SEP] it turns out that if you administer a placebo in the form of a white pill, that's like aspirin shaped -- it's just a round white pill -- it has some certain measurable effect. [SEP] pill blue effective change form give placebo make smaller color [SEP]
[CLS] pill white shaped effect turns administer placebo form aspirin round [SEP] but if you change the form that you give the placebo in, like you make a smaller pill, and color it blue, and stamp a letter into it, it is actually measurably more effective. [SEP] pharmaceutical pills things sugar [SEP]
[CLS] pill blue effective change form give placebo make smaller color [SEP] even though neither one of these things has any pharmaceutical -- they're sugar pills. [SEP] pill white good blue [SEP]
[CLS] pharmaceutical pills things sugar [SEP] but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill. [SEP] flipped [SEP]
[CLS] pill white good blue [SEP] what? that really flipped me out. [SEP] turns stops [SEP]
[CLS] flipped [SEP] turns out though, that that's not even where it stops. [SEP] capsules form effective tablets [SEP]
[CLS] turns stops [SEP] if you have capsules, they're more effective than tablets in any form. [SEP] capsule colored yellow end red white [SEP]
[CLS] capsules form effective tablets [SEP] a colored capsule, that's yellow on one end and red on the other is better than a white capsule. [SEP] dosage [SEP]
[CLS] capsule colored yellow end red white [SEP] dosage has something to do with this. [SEP] day good remember statistic pill pills [SEP]
[CLS] dosage [SEP] one pill twice a day is not as good at three pills -- i don't remember the statistic now. sorry. [SEP] point [SEP]
[CLS] day good remember statistic pill pills [SEP] but the point is... [SEP] dosages [SEP]
[CLS] point [SEP] ... these dosages have something to do with it. [SEP] form [SEP]
[CLS] dosages [SEP] and the form has something to do with it. [SEP] placebo needle ultimate [SEP]
[CLS] form [SEP] and if you want the ultimate in placebo, you've go to the needle. [SEP] inert patient syringe couple ccs inject [SEP]
[CLS] placebo needle ultimate [SEP] right? a syringe with some inert -- a couple ccs of some inert something, and you inject this into a patient... [SEP] mind pill powerful image stronger white [SEP]
[CLS] inert patient syringe couple ccs inject [SEP] well this is such a powerful image in their mind, it's so much stronger than the white pill. [SEP] graph slides show time [SEP]
[CLS] mind pill powerful image stronger white [SEP] it's a really, this graph, well i'll show it to you some other time when we have slides. [SEP] good pill needle point white blue capsule [SEP]
[CLS] graph slides show time [SEP] the point is the white pill is not as good as the blue pill is not as good as the capsule is not as good as the needle. [SEP] real makes quality effect pharmaceutical belief body stronger [SEP]
[CLS] good pill needle point white blue capsule [SEP] and none of it has any real pharmaceutical quality, it's only your belief that makes it real in your body and makes a stronger effect. [SEP] trick wanted idea apply magic [SEP]
[CLS] real makes quality effect pharmaceutical belief body stronger [SEP] i wanted to see if i could take that idea and apply it to a magic trick. [SEP] real fake trick make [SEP]
[CLS] trick wanted idea apply magic [SEP] and take something that is obviously a fake trick and make it seem real. [SEP] reality needle study [SEP]
[CLS] real fake trick make [SEP] and we know from that study that when you want reality, you go to the needle. [SEP] hatpin seven-inch sharp bit sterilize tiny [SEP]
[CLS] reality needle study [SEP] this is a seven-inch hatpin. it's very, very sharp, and i'm going to just sterilize it a tiny bit. [SEP] flesh damian special-grown [SEP]
[CLS] hatpin seven-inch sharp bit sterilize tiny [SEP] this is really my flesh. this is not damian's special-grown flesh. [SEP] skin effect hollywood special [SEP]

[CLS] side pierce skin run needle [SEP] if you're queasy -- if you faint easily -- i was doing this for some friends in the hotel room last night, and some people that i didn't know, and one woman almost passed out. [SEP] fact suggest queasy easy bad part [SEP]
[CLS] queasy easily night faint friends hotel room people woman passed [SEP] so, i suggest if you get queasy easy that you look away for about the next 30 -- in fact, you know what, i'll do the first bad part behind it. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] fact suggest queasy easy bad part [SEP] you'll get to see, you can look away too if you'd like to. [SEP] pierce beginning flesh lower part arm make [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] so, here is what happens, right here, the beginning of my flesh at the lower part of my arm i just make a little pierce. [SEP] man freaking [SEP]
[CLS] pierce beginning flesh lower part arm make [SEP] i'm sorry, man. am i freaking you out? [SEP] bit skin tiny side [SEP]
[CLS] man freaking [SEP] ok, and then just through my skin a tiny bit, and then out the other side like this. [SEP] essentially trick position knife [SEP]
[CLS] bit skin tiny side [SEP] now, essentially we're in the same position we were in with the knife trick. [SEP] sort [SEP]
[CLS] essentially trick position knife [SEP] sort of. [SEP] count fingers [SEP]
[CLS] sort [SEP] but you can't count my fingers right now can you? [SEP] show you. [SEP]

[CLS] people satellite room starting move [SEP] let me give you good close look at this. [SEP] effect skin. hollywood special [SEP]
[CLS] give good close [SEP] that really is my skin. that is not a hollywood special effect. [SEP] flesh twist [SEP]
[CLS] effect skin. hollywood special [SEP] that's my flesh, and i can twist that around. [SEP] queasy thing [SEP]
[CLS] flesh twist [SEP] i'm sorry. if you're getting queasy, look away, don't look at the thing. [SEP] real hole people yeah bleeding back video years watching kind [SEP]
[CLS] queasy thing [SEP] people in the back or people on video years from now watching this will go, "well yeah, that looks kind of neat in some sort of effect there, but if it were real he would be -- see there's a hole there and a hole there, if it were real he would be bleeding.

[CLS]  [SEP] normally now, i would take the needle out. [SEP] arm wounds clean show [SEP]
[CLS] needle [SEP] i would clean off my arm, and i would show you that there are no wounds. [SEP] real stage context idea taking fake making leave walk [SEP]
[CLS] arm wounds clean show [SEP] but i think in this context and with the idea of taking something fake and making it into something real, i'm just going to leave it there, and walk off the stage. [SEP] days times [SEP]
[CLS] real stage context idea taking fake making leave walk [SEP] i will be seeing you several times over the next few days. [SEP] hope forward [SEP]

[CLS] days talks happiness [SEP] i had somebody count the number of books with "happiness" in the title published in the last five years and they gave up after about 40, and there were many more. [SEP] happiness researchers huge wave interest [SEP]
[CLS] happiness count number books title published years gave [SEP] there is a huge wave of interest in happiness, among researchers. [SEP] coaching lot happiness [SEP]
[CLS] happiness researchers huge wave interest [SEP] there is a lot of happiness coaching. [SEP] happier make people [SEP]
[CLS] coaching lot happiness [SEP] everybody would like to make people happier. [SEP] work happiness spite flood cognitive traps sort make impossible straight [SEP]
[CLS] happier make people [SEP] but in spite of all this flood of work, there are several cognitive traps that sort of make it almost impossible to think straight about happiness. [SEP] traps talk today cognitive [SEP]
[CLS] work happiness spite flood cognitive traps sort make impossible straight [SEP] and my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive traps. [SEP] happiness applies thinking laypeople scholars turns messed [SEP]
[CLS] traps talk today cognitive [SEP] this applies to laypeople thinking about their own happiness, and it applies to scholars thinking about happiness, because it turns out we're just as messed up as anybody else is. [SEP] complexity traps reluctance admit [SEP]
[CLS] happiness applies thinking laypeople scholars turns messed [SEP] the first of these traps is a reluctance to admit complexity. [SEP] happiness anymore things word turns apply [SEP]
[CLS] complexity traps reluctance admit [SEP] it turns out that the word "happiness" is just not a useful word anymore, because we apply it to too many different things. [SEP] large meaning restrict give adopt complicated view well-being [SEP]
[CLS] happiness anymore things word turns apply [SEP] i think there is one particular meaning to which we might restrict it, but by and large, this is something that we'll have to give up and we'll have to adopt the more complicated view of what well-being is. [SEP] life basically happy memory trap confusion experience [SEP]
[CLS] large meaning restrict give adopt complicated view well-being [SEP] the second trap is a confusion between experience and memory; basically, it's between being happy in your life, and being happy about your life or happy with your life. [SEP] concepts happiness lumped notion [SEP]
[CLS] life basically happy memory trap confusion experience [SEP] and those are two very different concepts, and they're both lumped in the notion of happiness. [SEP] illusion importance focusing unfortunate fact circumstance affects well-being distorting [SEP]
[CLS] concepts happiness lumped notion [SEP] and the third is the focusing illusion, and it's the unfortunate fact that we can't think about any circumstance that affects well-being without distorting its importance. [SEP] trap real cognitive [SEP]
[CLS] illusion importance focusing unfortunate fact circumstance affects well-being distorting [SEP] i mean, this is a real cognitive trap. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] trap real cognitive [SEP] there's just no way of getting it right. [SEP] story session symphony recording sound start lectures reported listening absolutely [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] now, i'd like to start with an example of somebody who had a question-and-answer session after one of my lectures reported a story, and that was a story -- he said he'd been listening to a symphony, and it was absolutely glorious music and at the very end of the recording, there was a dreadful screeching sound. [SEP] added emotionally experience ruined [SEP]
[CLS] story session symphony recording sound start lectures reported listening absolutely [SEP] and then he added, really quite emotionally, it ruined the whole experience. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] added emotionally experience ruined [SEP] but it hadn't. [SEP] experience ruined memories [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] what it had ruined were the memories of the experience. [SEP] experience [SEP]
[CLS] experience ruined memories [SEP] he had had the experience. [SEP] minutes music glorious [SEP]
[CLS] experience [SEP] he had had 20 minutes of glorious music. [SEP] memory ruined counted left [SEP]
[CLS] minutes music glorious [SEP] they counted for nothing because he was left with a memory; the memory was ruined, and the memory was all that he had gotten to keep. [SEP] telling thinking people terms [SEP]
[CLS] memory ruined counted left [SEP] what this is telling us, really, is that we might be thinking of ourselves and of other people in terms of two selves. [SEP] present past experiencing lives capable re-living basically [SEP]
[CLS] telling thinking people terms [SEP] there is an experiencing self, who lives in the present and knows the present, is capable of re-living the past, but basically it has only the present. [SEP] doctor approaches experiencing hurt touch [SEP]
[CLS] present past experiencing lives capable re-living basically [SEP] it's the experiencing self that the doctor approaches -- you know, when the doctor asks, "does it hurt now when i touch you here?" [SEP] remembering score life question maintains story doctor approaches feeling [SEP]
[CLS] doctor approaches experiencing hurt touch [SEP] and then there is a remembering self, and the remembering self is the one that keeps score, and maintains the story of our life, and it's the one that the doctor approaches in asking the question, "how have you been feeling lately?" [SEP] albania trip [SEP]
[CLS] remembering score life question maintains story doctor approaches feeling [SEP] or "how was your trip to albania?" or something like that. [SEP] entities happiness experiencing remembering confused part mess notion [SEP]
[CLS] albania trip [SEP] those are two very different entities, the experiencing self and the remembering self, and getting confused between them is part of the mess about the notion of happiness. [SEP] storyteller remembering [SEP]
[CLS] entities happiness experiencing remembering confused part mess notion [SEP] now, the remembering self is a storyteller. [SEP] memories immediately starts basic response [SEP]
[CLS] storyteller remembering [SEP] and that really starts with a basic response of our memories -- it starts immediately. [SEP] stories set [SEP]
[CLS] memories immediately starts basic response [SEP] we don't only tell stories when we set out to tell stories. [SEP] stories story memory experiences [SEP]
[CLS] stories set [SEP] our memory tells us stories, that is, what we get to keep from our experiences is a story. [SEP] begin [SEP]
[CLS] stories story memory experiences [SEP] and let me begin with one example. [SEP] study [SEP]
[CLS] begin [SEP] this is an old study. [SEP] procedure actual patients undergoing painful [SEP]
[CLS] study [SEP] those are actual patients undergoing a painful procedure. [SEP] detail painful days longer study run [SEP]
[CLS] procedure actual patients undergoing painful [SEP] i won't go into detail. it's no longer painful these days, but it was painful when this study was run in the 1990s. [SEP] asked report pain [SEP]
[CLS] detail painful days longer study run [SEP] they were asked to report on their pain every 60 seconds. [SEP] patients recordings [SEP]
[CLS] asked report pain [SEP] here are two patients, those are their recordings. [SEP] asked suffered [SEP]
[CLS] patients recordings [SEP] and you are asked, "who of them suffered more?" [SEP] question easy [SEP]
[CLS] asked suffered [SEP] and it's a very easy question. [SEP] patient longer suffered colonoscopy minute pain [SEP]
[CLS] question easy [SEP] clearly, patient b suffered more -- his colonoscopy was longer, and every minute of pain that patient a had, patient b had, and more. [SEP] question suffered patients [SEP]
[CLS] patient longer suffered colonoscopy minute pain [SEP] but now there is another question: "how much did these patients think they suffered?" [SEP] surprise [SEP]
[CLS] question suffered patients [SEP] and here is a surprise. [SEP] patient surprise worse memory colonoscopy [SEP]
[CLS] surprise [SEP] the surprise is that patient a had a much worse memory of the colonoscopy than patient b. [SEP] ends stories colonoscopies critical part story [SEP]
[CLS] patient surprise worse memory colonoscopy [SEP] the stories of the colonoscopies were different, and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends. [SEP] great distinct stories inspiring [SEP]
[CLS] ends stories colonoscopies critical part story [SEP] and neither of these stories is very inspiring or great -- but one of them is this distinct... [SEP] distinctly worse [SEP]
[CLS] great distinct stories inspiring [SEP] but one of them is distinctly worse than the other. [SEP] end story worse pain peak bad [SEP]
[CLS] distinctly worse [SEP] and the one that is worse is the one where pain was at its peak at the very end; it's a bad story. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] end story worse pain peak bad [SEP] how do we know that? [SEP] colonoscopy thing total asked people bad [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] because we asked these people after their colonoscopy, and much later, too, "how bad was the whole thing, in total?" [SEP] memory worse [SEP]
[CLS] colonoscopy thing total asked people bad [SEP] and it was much worse for a than for b, in memory. [SEP] direct conflict experiencing remembering [SEP]
[CLS] memory worse [SEP] now this is a direct conflict between the experiencing self and the remembering self. [SEP] time point view experiencing worse [SEP]
[CLS] direct conflict experiencing remembering [SEP] from the point of view of the experiencing self, clearly, b had a worse time. [SEP] patient experiments work ran clinical extend colonoscopy keeping tube jiggling [SEP]
[CLS] time point view experiencing worse [SEP] now, what you could do with patient a, and we actually ran clinical experiments, and it has been done, and it does work -- you could actually extend the colonoscopy of patient a by just keeping the tube in without jiggling it too much. [SEP] suffer patient [SEP]
[CLS] patient experiments work ran clinical extend colonoscopy keeping tube jiggling [SEP] that will cause the patient to suffer, but just a little and much less than before. [SEP] patient minutes experience couple made experiencing worse remembering lot endowed [SEP]
[CLS] suffer patient [SEP] and if you do that for a couple of minutes, you have made the experiencing self of patient a worse off, and you have the remembering self of patient a a lot better off, because now you have endowed patient a with a better story about his experience. [SEP] story defines [SEP]
[CLS] patient minutes experience couple made experiencing worse remembering lot endowed [SEP] what defines a story? [SEP] stories true memory delivers make [SEP]
[CLS] story defines [SEP] and that is true of the stories that memory delivers for us, and it's also true of the stories that we make up. [SEP] significant endings defines story moments [SEP]
[CLS] stories true memory delivers make [SEP] what defines a story are changes, significant moments and endings. [SEP] case dominated important endings ending [SEP]
[CLS] significant endings defines story moments [SEP] endings are very, very important and, in this case, the ending dominated. [SEP] continuously experiencing lives life [SEP]
[CLS] case dominated important endings ending [SEP] now, the experiencing self lives its life continuously. [SEP] experience moments [SEP]
[CLS] continuously experiencing lives life [SEP] it has moments of experience, one after the other. [SEP] moments [SEP]
[CLS] experience moments [SEP] and you can ask: what happens to these moments? [SEP] straightforward forever answer lost [SEP]
[CLS] moments [SEP] and the answer is really straightforward: they are lost forever. [SEP] life calculated long million month trace moments psychological present leave [SEP]
[CLS] straightforward forever answer lost [SEP] i mean, most of the moments of our life -- and i calculated, you know, the psychological present is said to be about three seconds long; that means that, you know, in a life there are about 600 million of them; in a month, there are about 600,000 -- most of them don't leave a trace. [SEP] completely remembering [SEP]
[CLS] life calculated long million month trace moments psychological present leave [SEP] most of them are completely ignored by the remembering self. [SEP] count life sense moments experience [SEP]
[CLS] completely remembering [SEP] and yet, somehow you get the sense that they should count, that what happens during these moments of experience is our life. [SEP] earth finite resource spending [SEP]
[CLS] count life sense moments experience [SEP] it's the finite resource that we're spending while we're on this earth. [SEP] relevant spend story remembering [SEP]
[CLS] earth finite resource spending [SEP] and how to spend it would seem to be relevant, but that is not the story that the remembering self keeps for us. [SEP] distinct remembering experiencing [SEP]
[CLS] relevant spend story remembering [SEP] so we have the remembering self and the experiencing self, and they're really quite distinct. [SEP] time biggest difference handling [SEP]
[CLS] distinct remembering experiencing [SEP] the biggest difference between them is in the handling of time. [SEP] good vacation point view experiencing week two-week one-week [SEP]
[CLS] time biggest difference handling [SEP] from the point of view of the experiencing self, if you have a vacation, and the second week is just as good as the first, then the two-week vacation is twice as good as the one-week vacation. [SEP] works remembering [SEP]
[CLS] good vacation point view experiencing week two-week one-week [SEP] that's not the way it works at all for the remembering self. [SEP] added vacation remembering two-week barely one-week memories [SEP]
[CLS] works remembering [SEP] for the remembering self, a two-week vacation is barely better than the one-week vacation because there are no new memories added. [SEP] story changed [SEP]
[CLS] added vacation remembering two-week barely one-week memories [SEP] you have not changed the story. [SEP] time story critical variable distinguishes remembering experiencing impact [SEP]
[CLS] story changed [SEP] and in this way, time is actually the critical variable that distinguishes a remembering self from an experiencing self; time has very little impact on the story. [SEP] stories remembering remember [SEP]
[CLS] time story critical variable distinguishes remembering experiencing impact [SEP] now, the remembering self does more than remember and tell stories. [SEP] bad chosen makes decisions patient colonoscopies deciding memory surgeons choose [SEP]
[CLS] stories remembering remember [SEP] it is actually the one that makes decisions because, if you have a patient who has had, say, two colonoscopies with two different surgeons and is deciding which of them to choose, then the one that chooses is the one that has the memory that is less bad, and that's the surgeon that will be chosen. [SEP] choice experiencing voice [SEP]
[CLS] bad chosen makes decisions patient colonoscopies deciding memory surgeons choose [SEP] the experiencing self has no voice in this choice. [SEP] experiences choose memories [SEP]
[CLS] choice experiencing voice [SEP] we actually don't choose between experiences, we choose between memories of experiences. [SEP] experiences future [SEP]
[CLS] experiences choose memories [SEP] and even when we think about the future, we don't think of our future normally as experiences. [SEP] memories future anticipated [SEP]
[CLS] experiences future [SEP] we think of our future as anticipated memories. [SEP] remembering experiencing basically tyranny sort dragging experiences [SEP]
[CLS] memories future anticipated [SEP] and basically you can look at this, you know, as a tyranny of the remembering self, and you can think of the remembering self sort of dragging the experiencing self through experiences that the experiencing self doesn't need. [SEP] vacations case extent sense frequently large service remembering [SEP]
[CLS] remembering experiencing basically tyranny sort dragging experiences [SEP] i have that sense that when we go on vacations this is very frequently the case; that is, we go on vacations, to a very large extent, in the service of our remembering self. [SEP] bit hard justify [SEP]
[CLS] vacations case extent sense frequently large service remembering [SEP] and this is a bit hard to justify i think. [SEP] memories consume [SEP]
[CLS] bit hard justify [SEP] i mean, how much do we consume our memories? [SEP] explanations dominance remembering [SEP]
[CLS] memories consume [SEP] that is one of the explanations that is given for the dominance of the remembering self. [SEP] vacation ago relative antarctica years vacations [SEP]
[CLS] explanations dominance remembering [SEP] and when i think about that, i think about a vacation we had in antarctica a few years ago, which was clearly the best vacation i've ever had, and i think of it relatively often, relative to how much i think of other vacations. [SEP] trip minutes years consumed memories three-week [SEP]
[CLS] vacation ago relative antarctica years vacations [SEP] and i probably have consumed my memories of that three-week trip, i would say, for about 25 minutes in the last four years. [SEP] pictures hour opened folder spent [SEP]
[CLS] trip minutes years consumed memories three-week [SEP] now, if i had ever opened the folder with the 600 pictures in it, i would have spent another hour. [SEP] weeks half hour [SEP]
[CLS] pictures hour opened folder spent [SEP] now, that is three weeks, and that is at most an hour and a half. [SEP] discrepancy [SEP]
[CLS] weeks half hour [SEP] there seems to be a discrepancy. [SEP] put extreme memories question experiences weight bit appetite consuming genuine [SEP]
[CLS] discrepancy [SEP] now, i may be a bit extreme, you know, in how little appetite i have for consuming memories, but even if you do more of this, there is a genuine question: why do we put so much weight on memory relative to the weight that we put on experiences? [SEP] experiment thought [SEP]
[CLS] put extreme memories question experiences weight bit appetite consuming genuine [SEP] so i want you to think about a thought experiment. [SEP] vacation imagine destroyed end pictures amnesic drug remember [SEP]
[CLS] experiment thought [SEP] imagine that for your next vacation, you know that at the end of the vacation all your pictures will be destroyed, and you'll get an amnesic drug so that you won't remember anything. [SEP] vacation choose [SEP]
[CLS] vacation imagine destroyed end pictures amnesic drug remember [SEP] now, would you choose the same vacation? [SEP] terms answer conflict vacation obvious time memories choose adjudicate [SEP]
[CLS] vacation choose [SEP] and if you would choose a different vacation, there is a conflict between your two selves, and you need to think about how to adjudicate that conflict, and it's actually not at all obvious, because if you think in terms of time, then you get one answer, and if you think in terms of memories, you might get another answer. [SEP] pick vacations problem confronts choice [SEP]
[CLS] terms answer conflict vacation obvious time memories choose adjudicate [SEP] why do we pick the vacations we do is a problem that confronts us with a choice between the two selves. [SEP] happiness bring notions [SEP]
[CLS] pick vacations problem confronts choice [SEP] now, the two selves bring up two notions of happiness. [SEP] apply concepts happiness [SEP]
[CLS] happiness bring notions [SEP] there are really two concepts of happiness that we can apply, one per self. [SEP] happy experiencing [SEP]
[CLS] apply concepts happiness [SEP] so you can ask: how happy is the experiencing self? [SEP] life happy moments experiencing [SEP]
[CLS] happy experiencing [SEP] and then you would ask: how happy are the moments in the experiencing self's life? [SEP] happiness process moments fairly complicated [SEP]
[CLS] life happy moments experiencing [SEP] and they're all -- happiness for moments is a fairly complicated process. [SEP] measured emotions [SEP]
[CLS] happiness process moments fairly complicated [SEP] what are the emotions that can be measured? [SEP] time capable pretty good idea happiness experiencing [SEP]
[CLS] measured emotions [SEP] and, by the way, now we are capable of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experiencing self over time. [SEP] thing happiness remembering completely [SEP]
[CLS] time capable pretty good idea happiness experiencing [SEP] if you ask for the happiness of the remembering self, it's a completely different thing. [SEP] lives happily person [SEP]
[CLS] thing happiness remembering completely [SEP] this is not about how happily a person lives. [SEP] life person satisfied pleased [SEP]
[CLS] lives happily person [SEP] it is about how satisfied or pleased the person is when that person thinks about her life. [SEP] notion [SEP]
[CLS] life person satisfied pleased [SEP] very different notion. [SEP] study happiness well-being distinguish notions mess belong crowd students messing [SEP]
[CLS] notion [SEP] anyone who doesn't distinguish those notions is going to mess up the study of happiness, and i belong to a crowd of students of well-being, who've been messing up the study of happiness for a long time in precisely this way. [SEP] years separately distinction happiness experiencing satisfaction remembering recognized recent efforts [SEP]
[CLS] study happiness well-being distinguish notions mess belong crowd students messing [SEP] the distinction between the happiness of the experiencing self and the satisfaction of the remembering self has been recognized in recent years, and there are now efforts to measure the two separately. [SEP] experiences lines gallup organization world poll half million people asked [SEP]
[CLS] years separately distinction happiness experiencing satisfaction remembering recognized recent efforts [SEP] the gallup organization has a world poll where more than half a million people have been asked questions about what they think of their life and about their experiences, and there have been other efforts along those lines. [SEP] years recent begun learn happiness [SEP]
[CLS] experiences lines gallup organization world poll half million people asked [SEP] so in recent years, we have begun to learn about the happiness of the two selves. [SEP] main lesson learned [SEP]
[CLS] years recent begun learn happiness [SEP] and the main lesson i think that we have learned is they are really different. [SEP] life versa satisfied teach happily living vice [SEP]
[CLS] main lesson learned [SEP] you can know how satisfied somebody is with their life, and that really doesn't teach you much about how happily they're living their life, and vice versa. [SEP] correlation give sense [SEP]
[CLS] life versa satisfied teach happily living vice [SEP] just to give you a sense of the correlation, the correlation is about .5. [SEP] told tall height met father feet [SEP]
[CLS] correlation give sense [SEP] what that means is if you met somebody, and you were told, "oh his father is six feet tall," how much would you know about his height? [SEP] height uncertainty lot [SEP]
[CLS] told tall height met father feet [SEP] well, you would know something about his height, but there's a lot of uncertainty. [SEP] uncertainty [SEP]
[CLS] height uncertainty lot [SEP] you have that much uncertainty. [SEP] ten ranked life scale lot uncertainty happy experiencing [SEP]
[CLS] uncertainty [SEP] if i tell you that somebody ranked their life eight on a scale of ten, you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy they are with their experiencing self. [SEP] low correlation [SEP]
[CLS] ten ranked life scale lot uncertainty happy experiencing [SEP] so the correlation is low. [SEP] controls satisfaction happiness [SEP]
[CLS] low correlation [SEP] we know something about what controls satisfaction of the happiness self. [SEP] important goals money [SEP]
[CLS] controls satisfaction happiness [SEP] we know that money is very important, goals are very important. [SEP] people spending happiness satisfied time [SEP]
[CLS] important goals money [SEP] we know that happiness is mainly being satisfied with people that we like, spending time with people that we like. [SEP] pleasures dominant [SEP]
[CLS] people spending happiness satisfied time [SEP] there are other pleasures, but this is dominant. [SEP] things maximize happiness end [SEP]
[CLS] pleasures dominant [SEP] so if you want to maximize the happiness of the two selves, you are going to end up doing very different things. [SEP] well-being bottom line happiness substitute [SEP]
[CLS] things maximize happiness end [SEP] the bottom line of what i've said here is that we really should not think of happiness as a substitute for well-being. [SEP] notion completely [SEP]
[CLS] well-being bottom line happiness substitute [SEP] it is a completely different notion. [SEP] quickly life live reason straight happiness attend things [SEP]
[CLS] notion completely [SEP] now, very quickly, another reason we cannot think straight about happiness is that we do not attend to the same things when we think about life, and we actually live. [SEP] california answer simple question happy people correct [SEP]
[CLS] quickly life live reason straight happiness attend things [SEP] so, if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in california, you are not going to get to the correct answer. [SEP] question ohio people happier california live [SEP]
[CLS] california answer simple question happy people correct [SEP] when you ask that question, you think people must be happier in california if, say, you live in ohio. [SEP] places climate california contrast living thinking [SEP]
[CLS] question ohio people happier california live [SEP] and what happens is when you think about living in california, you are thinking of the contrast between california and other places, and that contrast, say, is in climate. [SEP] important turns climate experiencing reflective decides happy people [SEP]
[CLS] places climate california contrast living thinking [SEP] well, it turns out that climate is not very important to the experiencing self and it's not even very important to the reflective self that decides how happy people are. [SEP] end charge california reflective people moving [SEP]
[CLS] important turns climate experiencing reflective decides happy people [SEP] but now, because the reflective self is in charge, you may end up -- some people may end up moving to california. [SEP] happier sort interesting trace happen people move california hope [SEP]
[CLS] end charge california reflective people moving [SEP] and it's sort of interesting to trace what is going to happen to people who move to california in the hope of getting happier. [SEP] happier experiencing [SEP]
[CLS] happier sort interesting trace happen people move california hope [SEP] well, their experiencing self is not going to get happier. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] happier experiencing [SEP] we know that. [SEP] happen happier ohio decision thing reminded horrible weather feel made [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] but one thing will happen: they will think they are happier, because, when they think about it, they'll be reminded of how horrible the weather was in ohio, and they will feel they made the right decision. [SEP] well-being difficult straight hope sense [SEP]
[CLS] happen happier ohio decision thing reminded horrible weather feel made [SEP] it is very difficult to think straight about well-being, and i hope i have given you a sense of how difficult it is. [SEP]  [SEP]

[CLS] daniel kahneman [SEP] i think the most interesting result that we found in the gallup survey is a number, which we absolutely did not expect to find. [SEP] found respect happiness experiencing [SEP]
[CLS] number find interesting result found gallup survey absolutely expect [SEP] we found that with respect to the happiness of the experiencing self. [SEP] feelings vary income looked [SEP]
[CLS] found respect happiness experiencing [SEP] when we looked at how feelings, vary with income. [SEP] dollars year income americans large sample turns representative [SEP]
[CLS] feelings vary income looked [SEP] and it turns out that, below an income of 60,000 dollars a year, for americans -- and that's a very large sample of americans, like 600,000, so it's a large representative sample -- below an income of 600,000 dollars a year... [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] dollars year income americans large sample turns representative [SEP] 60,000. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] dk: 60,000. [SEP] dollars year people unhappy progressively unhappier poorer [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] 60,000 dollars a year, people are unhappy, and they get progressively unhappier the poorer they get. [SEP] line absolutely flat [SEP]
[CLS] dollars year people unhappy progressively unhappier poorer [SEP] above that, we get an absolutely flat line. [SEP] flat rarely lines [SEP]
[CLS] line absolutely flat [SEP] i mean i've rarely seen lines so flat. [SEP] happiness money misery happening experiential lack measure buy buys [SEP]
[CLS] flat rarely lines [SEP] clearly, what is happening is money does not buy you experiential happiness, but lack of money certainly buys you misery, and we can measure that misery very, very clearly. [SEP] story terms remembering [SEP]
[CLS] happiness money misery happening experiential lack measure buy buys [SEP] in terms of the other self, the remembering self, you get a different story. [SEP] earn money satisfied [SEP]
[CLS] story terms remembering [SEP] the more money you earn, the more satisfied you are. [SEP] emotions hold [SEP]
[CLS] earn money satisfied [SEP] that does not hold for emotions. [SEP] liberty danny life happiness american endeavor pursuit [SEP]
[CLS] emotions hold [SEP] but danny, the whole american endeavor is about life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness. [SEP] finding taxation people turn upside policy [SEP]
[CLS] liberty danny life happiness american endeavor pursuit [SEP] if people took seriously that finding, i mean, it seems to turn upside down everything we believe about, like for example, taxation policy and so forth. [SEP] politicians generally chance country finding run public policy based [SEP]
[CLS] finding taxation people turn upside policy [SEP] is there any chance that politicians, that the country generally, would take a finding like that seriously and run public policy based on it? [SEP] policy recognition role happiness research public [SEP]
[CLS] politicians generally chance country finding run public policy based [SEP] dk: you know i think that there is recognition of the role of happiness research in public policy. [SEP] happening states recognition slow united question countries [SEP]
[CLS] policy recognition role happiness research public [SEP] the recognition is going to be slow in the united states, no question about that, but in the u.k., it is happening, and in other countries it is happening. [SEP] people policy recognizing thinking happiness public [SEP]
[CLS] happening states recognition slow united question countries [SEP] people are recognizing that they ought to be thinking of happiness when they think of public policy. [SEP] study debate happiness evaluation people experience life fairly [SEP]
[CLS] people policy recognizing thinking happiness public [SEP] it's going to take a while, and people are going to debate whether they want to study experience happiness, or whether they want to study life evaluation, so we need to have that debate fairly soon.

[CLS] study debate happiness evaluation people experience life fairly [SEP] how to enhance happiness goes very different ways depending on how you think, and whether you think of the remembering self or you think of the experiencing self. [SEP] policy influence years [SEP]

[CLS] primate upright [SEP] okay, so when we talk about how much time we're currently investing in playing games, the only way it makes sense to even think about it is to talk about time at the magnitude of human evolution, which is an extraordinary thing. [SEP] apt games turns spending time playing changing capable human [SEP]
[CLS] talk time games evolution thing investing playing makes sense magnitude [SEP] but it's also apt. because it turns out that by spending all this time playing games, we're actually changing what we are capable of as human beings. [SEP] species evolving collaborative hearty [SEP]
[CLS] apt games turns spending time playing changing capable human [SEP] we are evolving to be a more collaborative and hearty species. [SEP] true [SEP]
[CLS] species evolving collaborative hearty [SEP] this is true. i believe this. [SEP] statistic university spent hours interesting recently published researcher carnegie mellon [SEP]
[CLS] true [SEP] so, consider this really interesting statistic; it was recently published by a researcher at carnegie mellon university: the average young person today in a country with a strong gamer culture will have spent 10,000 hours playing online games by the age of 21. [SEP] hours reasons interesting number [SEP]
[CLS] statistic university spent hours interesting recently published researcher carnegie mellon [SEP] now 10,000 hours is a really interesting number for two reasons. [SEP] states hours attendance school children united exact amount time spend [SEP]
[CLS] hours reasons interesting number [SEP] first of all, for children in the united states 10,080 hours is the exact amount of time you will spend in school from fifth grade to high school graduation if you have perfect attendance. [SEP] learning school entire parallel track education young people good gamer [SEP]
[CLS] states hours attendance school children united exact amount time spend [SEP] so, we have an entire parallel track of education going on where young people are learning as much about what it takes to be a good gamer as they are learning about everything else in school. [SEP] outliers book read malcolm gladwell [SEP]
[CLS] learning school entire parallel track education young people good gamer [SEP] and some of you have probably read malcolm gladwell's new book "outliers." [SEP] success theory hour heard [SEP]
[CLS] outliers book read malcolm gladwell [SEP] so, you would have heard of his theory of success, the 10,000 hour theory of success. [SEP] master hours based great cognitive science research effortful study age [SEP]
[CLS] success theory hour heard [SEP] it's based on this great cognitive science research that if we can master 10,000 hours of effortful study at anything by the age of 21, we will be virtuosos at it. [SEP] world good greatest people [SEP]
[CLS] master hours based great cognitive science research effortful study age [SEP] we will be as good at whatever we do as the greatest people in the world. [SEP] gamers entire generation young people virtuoso [SEP]
[CLS] world good greatest people [SEP] and so, now what we're looking at is an entire generation of young people who are virtuoso gamers. [SEP] big question gamers good [SEP]
[CLS] gamers entire generation young people virtuoso [SEP] so, the big question is, "what exactly are gamers getting so good at?" [SEP] hands figure virtually unprecedented human resource [SEP]
[CLS] big question gamers good [SEP] because if we could figure that out, we would have a virtually unprecedented human resource on our hands. [SEP] games people world spend hour day playing online [SEP]
[CLS] hands figure virtually unprecedented human resource [SEP] this is how many people we now have in the world who spend at least an hour a day playing online games. [SEP] gamers million virtuoso people extraordinarily good [SEP]
[CLS] games people world spend hour day playing online [SEP] these are our virtuoso gamers, 500 million people who are extraordinarily good at something. [SEP] decade billion gamers extraordinarily good [SEP]
[CLS] gamers million virtuoso people extraordinarily good [SEP] and in the next decade we're going to have another billion gamers who are extraordinarily good at whatever that is. [SEP] coming [SEP]
[CLS] decade billion gamers extraordinarily good [SEP] if you don't know it already, this is coming. [SEP] china brazil world india online game industry developing consoles low [SEP]
[CLS] coming [SEP] the game industry is developing consoles that are low energy and that work with the wireless phone networks instead of broadband internet so that gamers all over the world, particularly in india, china, brazil, can get online. [SEP] decade expect billion gamers [SEP]
[CLS] china brazil world india online game industry developing consoles low [SEP] they expect one billion more gamers in the next decade. [SEP] billion gamers bring [SEP]
[CLS] decade expect billion gamers [SEP] it will bring us up to 1.5 billion gamers. [SEP] started games making virtuosos [SEP]
[CLS] billion gamers bring [SEP] so, i've started to think about what these games are making us virtuosos at. [SEP] things optimism urgent [SEP]
[CLS] started games making virtuosos [SEP] here are the four things i came up with. the first is urgent optimism. [SEP] self-motivation extreme [SEP]
[CLS] things optimism urgent [SEP] ok, think of this as extreme self-motivation. [SEP] urgent obstacle combined success optimism desire act immediately tackle belief [SEP]
[CLS] self-motivation extreme [SEP] urgent optimism is the desire to act immediately to tackle an obstacle, combined with the belief that we have a reasonable hope of success. [SEP] gamers epic win worth [SEP]
[CLS] urgent obstacle combined success optimism desire act immediately tackle belief [SEP] gamers always believe that an epic win is possible, and that it is always worth trying, and trying now. [SEP] gamers sit [SEP]
[CLS] gamers epic win worth [SEP] gamers don't sit around. [SEP] gamers fabric virtuosos weaving tight social [SEP]
[CLS] gamers sit [SEP] gamers are virtuosos at weaving a tight social fabric. [SEP] badly lot interesting research shows people play game beaten [SEP]
[CLS] gamers fabric virtuosos weaving tight social [SEP] there's a lot of interesting research that shows that we like people better after we play a game with them, even if they've beaten us badly. [SEP] reason lot trust play game [SEP]
[CLS] badly lot interesting research shows people play game beaten [SEP] and the reason is, it takes a lot of trust to play a game with someone. [SEP] rules goal trust spend time play stay game [SEP]
[CLS] reason lot trust play game [SEP] we trust that they will spend their time with us, that they will play by the same rules, value the same goal, they'll stay with the game until it's over. [SEP] playing cooperation game builds bonds trust [SEP]
[CLS] rules goal trust spend time play stay game [SEP] and so, playing a game together actually builds up bonds and trust and cooperation. [SEP] result build stronger social relationships [SEP]
[CLS] playing cooperation game builds bonds trust [SEP] and we actually build stronger social relationships as a result. [SEP] blissful productivity love [SEP]
[CLS] result build stronger social relationships [SEP] blissful productivity. i love it. [SEP] hours week kind job reason average world warcraft gamer plays [SEP]
[CLS] blissful productivity love [SEP] you know there's a reason why the average world of warcraft gamer plays for 22 hours a week, kind of a half-time job. [SEP] game relaxing playing happier working hard hanging [SEP]
[CLS] hours week kind job reason average world warcraft gamer plays [SEP] it's because we know, when we're playing a game, that we're actually happier working hard than we are relaxing, or hanging out. [SEP] optimized work human hard meaningful [SEP]
[CLS] game relaxing playing happier working hard hanging [SEP] we know that we are optimized, as human beings, to do hard meaningful work. [SEP] time work gamers hard [SEP]
[CLS] optimized work human hard meaningful [SEP] and gamers are willing to work hard all the time, if they're given the right work. [SEP] finally epic meaning [SEP]
[CLS] time work gamers hard [SEP] finally: epic meaning. [SEP] gamers stories love attached awe-inspiring missions human planetary-scale [SEP]
[CLS] finally epic meaning [SEP] gamers love to be attached to awe-inspiring missions to human planetary-scale stories. [SEP] perspective wikipedia biggest world bit trivia put wiki [SEP]
[CLS] gamers stories love attached awe-inspiring missions human planetary-scale [SEP] so, just one bit of trivia that helps put that into perspective: so, you all know wikipedia, biggest wiki in the world. [SEP] articles world wiki biggest warcraft [SEP]
[CLS] perspective wikipedia biggest world bit trivia put wiki [SEP] second biggest wiki in the world, with nearly 80,000 articles, is the world of warcraft wiki. [SEP] month million people [SEP]

[CLS] month million people [SEP] they have compiled more information about world of warcraft on the internet than any other topic covered on any other wiki in the world. [SEP] story building epic [SEP]
[CLS] world compiled information warcraft internet topic covered wiki [SEP] they are building an epic story. [SEP] warcraft building epic knowledge resource world [SEP]
[CLS] story building epic [SEP] they are building an epic knowledge resource about the world of warcraft. [SEP] thing gamers super-empowered hopeful individuals superpowers add [SEP]
[CLS] warcraft building epic knowledge resource world [SEP] okay, so these are four superpowers that add up to one thing: gamers are super-empowered, hopeful individuals. [SEP] world people individually capable changing [SEP]
[CLS] thing gamers super-empowered hopeful individuals superpowers add [SEP] these are people who believe that they are individually capable of changing the world. [SEP] problem capable changing virtual real worlds world [SEP]
[CLS] world people individually capable changing [SEP] and the only problem is that they believe that they are capable of changing virtual worlds and not the real world. [SEP] solve problem [SEP]
[CLS] problem capable changing virtual real worlds world [SEP] that's the problem that i'm trying to solve. [SEP] castronova economist named edward [SEP]
[CLS] solve problem [SEP] there's an economist named edward castronova. [SEP] brilliant work worlds people investing time energy money online [SEP]
[CLS] castronova economist named edward [SEP] his work is brilliant. he looks at why people are investing so much time and energy and money in online worlds. [SEP] environments witnessing amounts mass exodus virtual worlds online game [SEP]
[CLS] brilliant work worlds people investing time energy money online [SEP] and he says, "we're witnessing what amounts to no less than a mass exodus to virtual worlds and online game environments." [SEP] economist rational [SEP]
[CLS] environments witnessing amounts mass exodus virtual worlds online game [SEP] and he's an economist. so, he's rational. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] economist rational [SEP] and he says... [SEP] designer exuberant game [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] not like me -- i'm a game designer; i'm exuberant. [SEP] sense life makes perfect gamers achieve online worlds real [SEP]
[CLS] designer exuberant game [SEP] but he says that this makes perfect sense, because gamers can achieve more in online worlds than they can in real life. [SEP] life games real stronger social relationships feedback feel rewarded [SEP]
[CLS] sense life makes perfect gamers achieve online worlds real [SEP] they can have stronger social relationships in games than they can have in real life; they get better feedback and feel more rewarded in games than they do in real life. [SEP] makes perfect sense gamers spend time virtual real worlds world [SEP]
[CLS] life games real stronger social relationships feedback feel rewarded [SEP] so, he says for now it makes perfect sense for gamers to spend more time in virtual worlds than the real world. [SEP] rational agree [SEP]
[CLS] makes perfect sense gamers spend time virtual real worlds world [SEP] now, i also agree that that is rational, for now. [SEP] situation optimal [SEP]
[CLS] rational agree [SEP] but it is not, by any means, an optimal situation. [SEP] game start making real world [SEP]
[CLS] situation optimal [SEP] we have to start making the real world more like a game. [SEP] happened years ago inspiration [SEP]
[CLS] game start making real world [SEP] so, i take my inspiration from something that happened 2,500 years ago. [SEP] dice made knuckles ancient sheep [SEP]
[CLS] happened years ago inspiration [SEP] these are ancient dice, made out of sheep's knuckles. right? [SEP] controllers knuckles awesome game sheep [SEP]
[CLS] dice made knuckles ancient sheep [SEP] before we had awesome game controllers, we had sheep's knuckles. [SEP] represent game equipment designed human [SEP]
[CLS] controllers knuckles awesome game sheep [SEP] and these represent the first game equipment designed by human beings. [SEP] history herodotus familiar work ancient greek historian invented games [SEP]
[CLS] represent game equipment designed human [SEP] and if you're familiar with the work of the ancient greek historian herodotus, you might know this history, which is the history of who invented games and why. [SEP] games herodotus famine dice invented kingdom lydia time [SEP]
[CLS] history herodotus familiar work ancient greek historian invented games [SEP] herodotus says that games, particularly dice games, were invented in the kingdom of lydia during a time of famine. [SEP] apparently crazy severe famine king lydia decided [SEP]

[CLS] people suffering fighting [SEP] it was an extreme situation, they needed an extreme solution. [SEP] day herodotus policy eat games invented dice set kingdom-wide play [SEP]
[CLS] extreme situation solution needed [SEP] so, according to herodotus, they invented dice games and they set up a kingdom-wide policy: on one day, everybody would eat, and on the next day, everybody would play games. [SEP] games engaging productivity eat immersed playing dice immerse satisfying blissful [SEP]
[CLS] day herodotus policy eat games invented dice set kingdom-wide play [SEP] and they would be so immersed in playing the dice games because games are so engaging, and immerse us in such satisfying blissful productivity, they would ignore the fact that they had no food to eat.

[CLS] games engaging productivity eat immersed playing dice immerse satisfying blissful [SEP] and then on the next day, they would play games; and on the next day, they would eat. [SEP] herodotus passed years surviving famine eating day playing games [SEP]
[CLS] day games eat play [SEP] and according to herodotus, they passed 18 years this way, surviving through a famine by eating on one day and playing games on the next. [SEP] today games [SEP]
[CLS] herodotus passed years surviving famine eating day playing games [SEP] now, this is exactly, i think, how we're using games today. [SEP] suffering games escape real-world [SEP]
[CLS] today games [SEP] we're using games to escape real-world suffering. [SEP] environment life games real broken satisfying [SEP]
[CLS] suffering games escape real-world [SEP] we're using games to get away from everything that's broken in the real environment, everything that's not satisfying about real life, and we're getting what we need from games. [SEP] end [SEP]

[CLS] lydia live leaving thrive leave search place people survive resources [SEP] now, this sounds crazy, right? [SEP] dna recently etruscans empire lydians evidence shown led roman share [SEP]
[CLS] crazy sounds [SEP] but recently, dna evidence has shown that the etruscans, who then led to the roman empire, actually share the same dna as the ancient lydians. [SEP] recently scientists true suggested herodotus' crazy story [SEP]
[CLS] dna recently etruscans empire lydians evidence shown led roman share [SEP] and so, recently, scientists have suggested that herodotus' crazy story is actually true. [SEP] years famine geologists found evidence global cooling lasted explained [SEP]
[CLS] recently scientists true suggested herodotus' crazy story [SEP] and geologists have found evidence of a global cooling that lasted for nearly 20 years that could have explained the famine. [SEP] true crazy story [SEP]
[CLS] years famine geologists found evidence global cooling lasted explained [SEP] so, this crazy story might be true. [SEP] years saved games escaping inspired culture playing knew entire civilization [SEP]
[CLS] true crazy story [SEP] they might have actually saved their culture by playing games, escaping to games for 18 years, and then been so inspired, and knew so much about how to come together with games, that they actually saved the entire civilization that way. [SEP]  [SEP]

[CLS] truth society asset technology revealing rare powerful offer human ability [SEP] the human ability to adapt, it's an interesting thing, because people have continually wanted to talk to me about overcoming adversity, and i'm going to make an admission: this phrase never sat right with me, and i always felt uneasy trying to answer people's questions about it, and i think i'm starting to figure out why.

[CLS] people adapt thing adversity admission human ability interesting continually wanted [SEP] implicit in this phrase of "overcoming adversity" is the idea that success, or happiness, is about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience unscathed or unmarked by the experience, as if my successes in life have come about from an ability to sidestep or circumnavigate the presumed pitfalls of a life with prosthetics, or what other people perceive as my disability.

[CLS] importantly ability partnership perceived deficiencies greatest creative [SEP] so it's not about devaluing, or negating, these more trying times as something we want to avoid or sweep under the rug, but instead to find those opportunities wrapped in the adversity. [SEP] embracing grappling term idea put overcoming adversity opening wrestling dancing [SEP]
[CLS] devaluing negating rug adversity times avoid sweep find opportunities wrapped [SEP] so maybe the idea i want to put out there is not so much overcoming adversity as it is opening ourselves up to it, embracing it, grappling with it, to use a wrestling term, maybe even dancing with it.

[CLS] hat anatomy history [SEP] i'm a historian by training, and what i study in that case is the way that people have dealt with anatomy -- meaning human bodies, animal bodies -- how they dealt with bodily fluids, concepts of bodies; how have they thought about bodies.

[CLS] bodies dealt training anatomy meaning animal fluids concepts historian study [SEP] the other hat that i've worn in my work is as an activist, as a patient advocate -- or, as i sometimes say, as an impatient advocate -- for people who are patients of doctors.

[CLS] advocate activist doctors hat worn work impatient people patient patients [SEP] in that case, what i've worked with is people who have body types that challenge social norms. [SEP] twins body people worked conjoined [SEP]
[CLS] case norms worked people body types challenge social [SEP] so some of what i've worked on, for example, is people who are conjoined twins -- two people within one body. [SEP] people dwarfism typical worked shorter [SEP]
[CLS] twins body people worked conjoined [SEP] some of what i've worked on is people who have dwarfism -- so people who are much shorter than typical. [SEP] people standard sex types lot worked atypical male female body [SEP]
[CLS] people dwarfism typical worked shorter [SEP] and a lot of what i've worked on is people who have atypical sex -- so people who don't have the standard male or the standard female body types. [SEP] term general intersex [SEP]
[CLS] people standard sex types lot worked atypical male female body [SEP] and as a general term, we can use the term intersex for this. [SEP] intersex forms lot [SEP]
[CLS] term general intersex [SEP] intersex comes in a lot of different forms. [SEP] female give types sex standard male [SEP]
[CLS] intersex forms lot [SEP] i'll just give you a few examples of the types of ways you can have sex that isn't standard for male or female. [SEP] instance basis proto-gonads life testes chromosomal sry gene chromosome fetal [SEP]
[CLS] female give types sex standard male [SEP] so in one instance, you can have somebody who has an xy chromosomal basis, and that sry gene on the y chromosome tells the proto-gonads, which we all have in the fetal life, to become testes. [SEP] testosterone fetal life testes pumping [SEP]
[CLS] instance basis proto-gonads life testes chromosomal sry gene chromosome fetal [SEP] and so in the fetal life the testes are pumping out testosterone. [SEP] testosterone individual lacks receptors hear body react [SEP]
[CLS] testosterone fetal life testes pumping [SEP] but because this individual lacks receptors to hear that testosterone, the body doesn't react to the testosterone. [SEP] syndrome called androgen insensitivity [SEP]
[CLS] testosterone individual lacks receptors hear body react [SEP] and this is a syndrome called androgen insensitivity syndrome. [SEP] testosterone lots levels reaction [SEP]
[CLS] syndrome called androgen insensitivity [SEP] so lots of levels of testosterone, but no reaction to it. [SEP] consequence path body develops female typical [SEP]
[CLS] testosterone lots levels reaction [SEP] as a consequence, the body develops more along the female typical path. [SEP] born girl child [SEP]
[CLS] consequence path body develops female typical [SEP] when the child is born, she looks like a girl. [SEP] girl raised [SEP]
[CLS] born girl child [SEP] she is a girl. she is raised as a girl. [SEP] breasts period hits puberty growing developing figures [SEP]
[CLS] girl raised [SEP] and it's often not until she hits puberty and she's growing and developing breasts, but she's not getting her period, that somebody figures out something's up here. [SEP] inside uterus chromosome tests figure ovaries testes [SEP]
[CLS] breasts period hits puberty growing developing figures [SEP] and they do some tests and figure out that, instead of having ovaries inside and a uterus, she actually has testes inside, and she has a y chromosome. [SEP] male important understand person [SEP]
[CLS] inside uterus chromosome tests figure ovaries testes [SEP] now what's important to understand is you may think of this person as really being male, but they're really not. [SEP] females males glands bodies called adrenal [SEP]
[CLS] male important understand person [SEP] females, like males, have in our bodies something called the adrenal glands. [SEP] body back [SEP]
[CLS] females males glands bodies called adrenal [SEP] they're in the back of our body. [SEP] androgens hormone adrenal glands make masculinizing [SEP]
[CLS] body back [SEP] and the adrenal glands make androgens, which are a masculinizing hormone. [SEP] females typical androgen-sensitive female chromosomal make-up [SEP]
[CLS] androgens hormone adrenal glands make masculinizing [SEP] most females like me -- i believe myself to be a typical female -- i don't actually know my chromosomal make-up but i think i'm probably typical -- most females like me are actually androgen-sensitive. [SEP] androgen androgens making responding [SEP]
[CLS] females typical androgen-sensitive female chromosomal make-up [SEP] we're making androgen, and we're responding to androgens. [SEP] syndrome consequence brain exposed woman born testes insensitivity androgens androgen [SEP]
[CLS] androgen androgens making responding [SEP] the consequence is that somebody like me has actually had a brain exposed to more androgens than the woman born with testes who has androgen insensitivity syndrome. [SEP] sex complicated spectrum place intersex people middle [SEP]
[CLS] syndrome consequence brain exposed woman born testes insensitivity androgens androgen [SEP] so sex is really complicated; it's not just that intersex people are in the middle of all the sex spectrum -- in some ways, they can be all over the place. [SEP] boy girlfriend years raised inside ago call man born sex [SEP]
[CLS] sex complicated spectrum place intersex people middle [SEP] another example: a few years ago i got a call from a man who was 19 years old, who was born a boy, raised a boy, had a girlfriend, had sex with his girlfriend, had a life as a guy and had just found out that he had ovaries and a uterus inside.

[CLS] boy girlfriend years raised inside ago call man born sex [SEP] what he had was an extreme form of a condition called congenital adrenal hyperplasia. [SEP] essentially chromosomes womb created environment adrenal glands high gear masculine [SEP]
[CLS] hyperplasia extreme form condition called congenital adrenal [SEP] he had xx chromosomes, and in the womb, his adrenal glands were in such high gear that it created, essentially, a masculine hormonal environment. [SEP] consequence masculinzed hormones genitals brain subject typical masculine component [SEP]
[CLS] essentially chromosomes womb created environment adrenal glands high gear masculine [SEP] and as a consequence, his genitals were masculinzed, his brain was subject to the more typical masculine component of hormones. [SEP] boy born suspected [SEP]
[CLS] consequence masculinzed hormones genitals brain subject typical masculine component [SEP] and he was born looking like a boy -- nobody suspected anything. [SEP] internally fact reached age began medical problems menstruating doctors figured [SEP]
[CLS] boy born suspected [SEP] and it was only when he had reached the age of 19 that he began to have enough medical problems actually from menstruating internally, that doctors figured out that, in fact, he was female internally. [SEP] intersex quick [SEP]
[CLS] internally fact reached age began medical problems menstruating doctors figured [SEP] okay, so just one more quick example of a way you can have intersex. [SEP] ovotestis tissue people chromosomes develop called ovarian testicular wrapped [SEP]
[CLS] intersex quick [SEP] some people who have xx chromosomes develop what are called ovotestis, which is when you have ovarian tissue with testicular tissue wrapped around it. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] ovotestis tissue people chromosomes develop called ovarian testicular wrapped [SEP] and we're not exactly sure why that happens. [SEP] varieties sex lots [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] so sex can come in lots of different varieties. [SEP] bodies dwarfism twinning type health reason children kinds conjoined intersex [SEP]
[CLS] varieties sex lots [SEP] the reason that children with these kinds of bodies -- whether it's dwarfism, or it's conjoined twinning, or it's an intersex type -- are often normalized by surgeons is not because it actually leaves them better off in terms of physical health. [SEP] cases people healthy perfectly [SEP]
[CLS] bodies dwarfism twinning type health reason children kinds conjoined intersex [SEP] in many cases, people are actually perfectly healthy. [SEP] categories reason subject kinds surgeries threaten social [SEP]
[CLS] cases people healthy perfectly [SEP] the reason they're often subject to various kinds of surgeries is because they threaten our social categories. [SEP] identity system based typically idea kind anatomy [SEP]
[CLS] categories reason subject kinds surgeries threaten social [SEP] or system has been based typically on the idea that a particular kind of anatomy comes with a particular identity. [SEP] allegedly identity history concept woman female black person african anatomy [SEP]
[CLS] identity system based typically idea kind anatomy [SEP] so we have the concept that what it means to be a woman is to have a female identity; what it means to be a black person is, allegedly, is to have an african anatomy in terms of your history. [SEP] idea terribly simplistic [SEP]
[CLS] allegedly identity history concept woman female black person african anatomy [SEP] and so we have this terribly simplistic idea. [SEP] categorizations faced body presents startles terms [SEP]

[CLS] individualism lot romantic ideas culture [SEP] and our nation's really founded on a very romantic concept of individualism. [SEP] body imagine startling children born people inside [SEP]
[CLS] individualism nation founded romantic concept [SEP] well you can imagine how startling then it is when you have children that are born who are two people inside of one body. [SEP] runner caster semenya berlin ran heat recently year south african [SEP]

[CLS] female lot journalists calling test run caster semenya male [SEP] and i had to explain to the journalists there isn't such a test. [SEP] male female intersex nature draw line fact sex complicated admit [SEP]
[CLS] test explain journalists [SEP] in fact, we now know that sex is complicated enough that we have to admit nature doesn't draw the line for us between male and female, or between male and intersex and female and intersex; we actually draw that line on nature. [SEP] categories thought stable sort situation farther science admit anatomical mapped [SEP]
[CLS] male female intersex nature draw line fact sex complicated admit [SEP] so what we have is a sort of situation where the farther our science goes, the more we have to admit to ourselves that these categories that we thought of as stable anatomical categories that mapped very simply to stable identity categories are a lot more fuzzy than we thought. [SEP] sex terms [SEP]
[CLS] categories thought stable sort situation farther science admit anatomical mapped [SEP] and it's not just in terms of sex. [SEP] race allowed terms turns vastly complicated terminology [SEP]

[CLS] afterward happened years [SEP] what happened was women, for example, who wanted the right to vote, took the founding fathers' concept of anatomical commonality being more important than anatomical difference and said, "the fact that we have a uterus and ovaries is not significant enough in terms of a difference to mean that we shouldn't have the right to vote, the right to full citizenship, the right to own property, etc., etc." [SEP] women successfully argued [SEP]

[CLS] retain anatomical divisions make sense [SEP] but the challenge is trying to figure out which ones they are and why do we retain them and do they have meaning. [SEP] talk back conceived beginning [SEP]
[CLS] meaning challenge figure retain [SEP] so let's go back to those two beings conceived at the beginning of this talk. [SEP] day conceived middle exact [SEP]
[CLS] talk back conceived beginning [SEP] we have two beings, both conceived in the middle of 1979 on the exact same day. [SEP] mary prematurely june born imagine months [SEP]
[CLS] day conceived middle exact [SEP] let's imagine one of them, mary, is born three months prematurely, so she's born on june 1, 1980. [SEP] henry contrast term march born [SEP]
[CLS] mary prematurely june born imagine months [SEP] henry, by contrast, is born at term, so he's born on march 1, 1980. [SEP] months simply sex vote drink virtue fact mary born prematurely [SEP]
[CLS] henry contrast term march born [SEP] simply by virtue of the fact that mary was born prematurely three months, she comes into all sorts of rights three months earlier than henry does -- the right to consent to sex, the right to vote, the right to drink. [SEP] biologically henry age born wait terms [SEP]
[CLS] months simply sex vote drink virtue fact mary born prematurely [SEP] henry has to wait for all of that, not because he's actually any different in age, biologically, except in terms of when he was born. [SEP] find kinds weirdness terms [SEP]
[CLS] biologically henry age born wait terms [SEP] we find other kinds of weirdness in terms of what their rights are. [SEP] virtue assumed henry male drafted told liable mary worry [SEP]
[CLS] find kinds weirdness terms [SEP] henry, by virtue of being assumed to be male -- although i haven't told you that he's the xy one -- by virtue of being assumed to be male is now liable to be drafted, which mary does not need to worry about. [SEP] mary states marry henry [SEP]
[CLS] virtue assumed henry male drafted told liable mary worry [SEP] mary, meanwhile, cannot in all the states have the same right that henry has in all the states, namely, the right to marry. [SEP] woman henry marry mary today state states [SEP]
[CLS] mary states marry henry [SEP] henry can marry in every state a woman, but mary can only marry today in a few states a woman. [SEP] questionable anatomical categories persist problematic [SEP]
[CLS] woman henry marry mary today state states [SEP] so we have these anatomical categories that persist that are in many ways problematic and questionable. [SEP] anatomy question science good reach point admit democracy based start [SEP]
[CLS] questionable anatomical categories persist problematic [SEP] and the question to me becomes: what do we do, as our science gets to be so good in looking at anatomy, that we reach the point where we have to admit that a democracy that's been based on anatomy might start falling apart? [SEP] science give time kind feels coming [SEP]
[CLS] anatomy question science good reach point admit democracy based start [SEP] i don't want to give up the science, but at the same time it kind of feels sometimes like the science is coming out from under us. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] science give time kind feels coming [SEP] so where do we go? [SEP] line draw attitude culture sort pragmatic [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] it seems like what happens in our culture is a sort of pragmatic attitude: "well, we have to draw the line somewhere, so we will draw the line somewhere." [SEP] position lot people stuck strange [SEP]
[CLS] line draw attitude culture sort pragmatic [SEP] but a lot of people get stuck in a very strange position. [SEP] chromosome marry texas point decided man woman [SEP]
[CLS] position lot people stuck strange [SEP] so for example, texas has at one point decided that what it means to marry a man is to mean that you don't have a y chromosome, and what it means to marry a woman means you do have a y chromosome. [SEP] chromosomes practice test people [SEP]
[CLS] chromosome marry texas point decided man woman [SEP] now in practice they don't actually test people for their chromosomes. [SEP] bizarre syndrome story told beginning androgen insensitivity [SEP]
[CLS] chromosomes practice test people [SEP] but this is also very bizarre, because of the story i told you at the beginning about androgen insensitivity syndrome. [SEP] speech democracy king dream founding fathers modern martin luther offers [SEP]
[CLS] bizarre syndrome story told beginning androgen insensitivity [SEP] if we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy, dr. martin luther king, he offers us something of a solution in his "i have a dream" speech. [SEP] people based skin character moving anatomy judge color content [SEP]
[CLS] speech democracy king dream founding fathers modern martin luther offers [SEP] he says we should judge people "based not on the color of their skin, but on the content of their character," moving beyond anatomy. [SEP] yeah idea sounds good [SEP]
[CLS] people based skin character moving anatomy judge color content [SEP] and i want to say, "yeah, that sounds like a really good idea." [SEP] practice [SEP]
[CLS] yeah idea sounds good [SEP] but in practice, how do you do it? [SEP] character judge people based content [SEP]
[CLS] practice [SEP] how do you judge people based on the content of character? [SEP] humans admit point distribute terms golden retrievers deserving social services [SEP]
[CLS] character judge people based content [SEP] i also want to point out that i'm not sure that is how we should distribute rights in terms of humans, because, i have to admit, that there are some golden retrievers i know that are probably more deserving of social services than some humans i know. [SEP] intelligent informed mature yellow labradors capable decisions sexual relations [SEP]
[CLS] humans admit point distribute terms golden retrievers deserving social services [SEP] i also want to say there are probably also some yellow labradors that i know that are more capable of informed, intelligent, mature decisions about sexual relations than some 40-year-olds that i know. [SEP] character operationalize question content [SEP]
[CLS] intelligent informed mature yellow labradors capable decisions sexual relations [SEP] so how do we operationalize the question of content of character? [SEP] difficult turns [SEP]
[CLS] character operationalize question content [SEP] it turns out to be really difficult. [SEP] future fmri part content character turns scannable [SEP]
[CLS] difficult turns [SEP] and part of me also wonders, what if content of character turns out to be something that's scannable in the future -- able to be seen with an fmri? [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] future fmri part content character turns scannable [SEP] do we really want to go there? [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] i'm not sure where we go. [SEP] democracy important idea united states lead thinking issue [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] what i do know is that it seems to be really important to think about the idea of the united states being in the lead of thinking about this issue of democracy. [SEP] good job democracy future struggling [SEP]
[CLS] democracy important idea united states lead thinking issue [SEP] we've done a really good job struggling with democracy, and i think we would do a good job in the future. [SEP] murdered change live situation iran man sexually attracted men liable [SEP]
[CLS] good job democracy future struggling [SEP] we don't have a situation that iran has, for example, where a man who's sexually attracted to other men is liable to be murdered, unless he's willing to submit to a sex change, in which case he's allowed to live. [SEP] situation kind [SEP]
[CLS] murdered change live situation iran man sexually attracted men liable [SEP] we don't have that kind of situation. [SEP] partly glad kind situation surgeon talked years ago brought set [SEP]
[CLS] situation kind [SEP] i'm glad to say we don't have the kind of situation with -- a surgeon i talked to a few years ago who had brought over a set of conjoined twins in order to separate them, partly to make a name for himself. [SEP] surgery nation badly phone high-risk answer children treated [SEP]
[CLS] partly glad kind situation surgeon talked years ago brought set [SEP] but when i was on the phone with him, asking why he was going to do this surgery -- this was a very high-risk surgery -- his answer was that, in this other nation, these children were going to be treated very badly, and so he had to do this. [SEP] surgery response considered political asylum separation [SEP]
[CLS] surgery nation badly phone high-risk answer children treated [SEP] my response to him was, "well, have you considered political asylum instead of a separation surgery?" [SEP] united offered tremendous possibility allowing people changed sake states state [SEP]
[CLS] surgery response considered political asylum separation [SEP] the united states has offered tremendous possibility for allowing people to be the way they are, without having them have to be changed for the sake of the state. [SEP] lead [SEP]
[CLS] united offered tremendous possibility allowing people changed sake states state [SEP] so i think we have to be in the lead. [SEP] close fathers suggest talking lot [SEP]
[CLS] lead [SEP] well, just to close, i want to suggest to you that i've been talking a lot about the fathers. [SEP] mothers possibilities democracy looked involved [SEP]
[CLS] close fathers suggest talking lot [SEP] and i want to think about the possibilities of what democracy might look like, or might have looked like, if we had more involved the mothers. [SEP] kinds feminist anatomies groups bit radical insights people thinking [SEP]
[CLS] mothers possibilities democracy looked involved [SEP] and i want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist, and that is that i think that there may be different kinds of insights that can come from different kinds of anatomies, particularly when we have people thinking in groups. [SEP] interested years intersex research sex difference [SEP]
[CLS] kinds feminist anatomies groups bit radical insights people thinking [SEP] now for years, because i've been interested in intersex, i've also been interested in sex difference research. [SEP] world things interested differences males females terms operate [SEP]
[CLS] interested years intersex research sex difference [SEP] and one of the things that i've been really interested in is looking at the differences between males and females in terms of the way they think and operate in the world. [SEP] average females group cross-cultural studies inclined attentive complex social relations [SEP]
[CLS] world things interested differences males females terms operate [SEP] and what we know from cross-cultural studies is that females, on average -- not everyone, but on average -- are more inclined to be very attentive to complex social relations and to taking care of people who are basically vulnerable within the group. [SEP] hands interesting situation [SEP]
[CLS] average females group cross-cultural studies inclined attentive complex social relations [SEP] and so if we think about that, we have an interesting situation on our hands. [SEP] graduate years ago school feminism feminist asked question advisers knew [SEP]
[CLS] hands interesting situation [SEP] years ago, when i was in graduate school, one of my graduate advisers who knew i was interested in feminism -- i considered myself a feminist, as i still do -- asked a really strange question. [SEP] feminism feminine [SEP]
[CLS] graduate years ago school feminism feminist asked question advisers knew [SEP] he said, "tell me what's feminine about feminism." [SEP] thought heard dumbest question [SEP]
[CLS] feminism feminine [SEP] and i thought, "well that's the dumbest question i've ever heard. [SEP] feminism gender undoing stereotypes feminine [SEP]
[CLS] thought heard dumbest question [SEP] feminism is all about undoing stereotypes about gender, so there's nothing feminine about feminism. " [SEP] thought question feminism feminine [SEP]
[CLS] feminism gender undoing stereotypes feminine [SEP] but the more i thought about his question, the more i thought there might be something feminine about feminism. [SEP] attentive brains average vulnerable female male makes deeply complex social [SEP]
[CLS] thought question feminism feminine [SEP] that is to say, there might be something, on average, different about female brains from male brains that makes us more attentive to deeply complex social relationships and more attentive to taking care of the vulnerable. [SEP] protect concept state fathers extremely attentive figuring individuals injected mothers [SEP]
[CLS] attentive brains average vulnerable female male makes deeply complex social [SEP] so whereas the fathers were extremely attentive to figuring out how to protect individuals from the state, it's possible that if we injected more mothers into this concept, what we would have is more of a concept of, not just how to protect, but how to care for each other. [SEP] future anatomy body identity relationships democracy individual terms [SEP]
[CLS] protect concept state fathers extremely attentive figuring individuals injected mothers [SEP] and maybe that's where we need to go in the future, when we take democracy beyond anatomy, is to think less about the individual body, in terms of the identity, and think more about those relationships. [SEP] union people create perfect thinking [SEP]
[CLS] future anatomy body identity relationships democracy individual terms [SEP] so that as we the people try to create a more perfect union, we're thinking about what we do for each other. [SEP]  [SEP]

[CLS] race car driver good win [SEP] now today, if you want to win the race, actually you need also something like this -- something that monitors the car in real time, has a few thousand sensors collecting information from the car, transmitting this information into the system, and then processing it and using it in order to go back to the car with decisions and changing things in real time as information is collected. [SEP] terms system engineering call real time control [SEP]
[CLS] car real information time today race transmitting system collected win [SEP] this is what, in engineering terms, you would call a real time control system. [SEP] basically components component system made sensing actuating [SEP]
[CLS] terms system engineering call real time control [SEP] and basically, it's a system made of two components -- a sensing and an actuating component. [SEP] lives interesting today real time control systems starting enter [SEP]
[CLS] basically components component system made sensing actuating [SEP] what is interesting today is that real time control systems are starting to enter into our lives. [SEP] electronics cities years networks past blanketed [SEP]
[CLS] lives interesting today real time control systems starting enter [SEP] our cities, over the past few years, just have been blanketed with networks, electronics. [SEP] air computers open [SEP]
[CLS] electronics cities years networks past blanketed [SEP] they're becoming like computers in open air. [SEP] air actuated computers open starting respond sensed [SEP]
[CLS] air computers open [SEP] and, as computers in open air, they're starting to respond in a different way to be able to be sensed and to be actuated. [SEP] cities deal fix big [SEP]
[CLS] air actuated computers open starting respond sensed [SEP] if we fix cities, actually it's a big deal. [SEP] percent mention cities crust population wanted earth world [SEP]
[CLS] cities deal fix big [SEP] just as an aside, i wanted to mention, cities are only two percent of the earth's crust, but they are 50 percent of the world's population. [SEP] percent emissions consumption energy [SEP]
[CLS] percent mention cities crust population wanted earth world [SEP] they are 75 percent of the energy consumption -- up to 80 percent of co2 emissions. [SEP] cities deal big [SEP]

[CLS] week [SEP] with this information we realized there's a lot of inefficiencies in the system. [SEP] energy thing [SEP]
[CLS] system information realized lot inefficiencies [SEP] we can actually do the same thing with much less energy. [SEP] data [SEP]
[CLS] energy thing [SEP] this data was not available before. [SEP] happening lot wasted transportation convoluted things [SEP]
[CLS] data [SEP] but there's a lot of wasted transportation and convoluted things happening. [SEP] disappear planet thing day cup throwing [SEP]
[CLS] happening lot wasted transportation convoluted things [SEP] but the other thing is that we believe that if we see every day that the cup we're throwing away, it doesn't disappear, it's still somewhere on the planet. [SEP] plastic bottle throwing day stays [SEP]
[CLS] disappear planet thing day cup throwing [SEP] and the plastic bottle we're throwing away every day still stays there. [SEP] people change show promote behavioral [SEP]
[CLS] plastic bottle throwing day stays [SEP] and if we show that to people, then we can also promote some behavioral change. [SEP] project reason [SEP]
[CLS] people change show promote behavioral [SEP] so that was the reason for the project. [SEP] mit assaf biderman beginning environment sensing colleague wonderful things wanted [SEP]
[CLS] project reason [SEP] my colleague at mit, assaf biderman, he could tell you much more about sensing and many other wonderful things we can do with sensing, but i wanted to go to the second part we discussed at the beginning, and that's actuating our environment. [SEP] spain zaragoza project couple years ago [SEP]
[CLS] mit assaf biderman beginning environment sensing colleague wonderful things wanted [SEP] and the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in zaragoza, spain. [SEP] city space architecture started question mayor spain southern europe beautiful [SEP]
[CLS] spain zaragoza project couple years ago [SEP] it started with a question by the mayor of the city, who came to us saying that spain and southern europe have a beautiful tradition of using water in public space, in architecture. [SEP] technology question added [SEP]
[CLS] city space architecture started question mayor spain southern europe beautiful [SEP] and the question was: how could technology, new technology, be added to that? [SEP] valves taps imagine pipe solenoid opening closing ideas developed mit [SEP]
[CLS] technology question added [SEP] and one of the ideas that was developed at mit in a workshop was, imagine this pipe, and you've got valves, solenoid valves, taps, opening and closing. [SEP] water create curtain pixels made [SEP]
[CLS] valves taps imagine pipe solenoid opening closing ideas developed mit [SEP] you create like a water curtain with pixels made of water. [SEP] images text fall patterns pixels write show [SEP]
[CLS] water create curtain pixels made [SEP] if those pixels fall, you can write on it, you can show patterns, images, text. [SEP] image approach open jump [SEP]
[CLS] images text fall patterns pixels write show [SEP] and even you can approach it, and it will open up to let you jump through, as you see in this image. [SEP] belloch presented mayor [SEP]
[CLS] image approach open jump [SEP] well, we presented this to mayor belloch. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] belloch presented mayor [SEP] he liked it very much. [SEP] expo commission design building entrance [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] and we got a commission to design a building at the entrance of the expo. [SEP] pavilion called digital water [SEP]
[CLS] expo commission design building entrance [SEP] we called it digital water pavilion. [SEP] water building made [SEP]
[CLS] pavilion called digital water [SEP] the whole building is made of water. [SEP] windows doors approach open [SEP]
[CLS] water building made [SEP] there's no doors or windows, but when you approach it, it will open up to let you in. [SEP] water roof covered [SEP]
[CLS] windows doors approach open [SEP] the roof also is covered with water. [SEP] wind splashing roof bit minimize lower [SEP]
[CLS] water roof covered [SEP] and if there's a bit of wind, if you want to minimize splashing, you can actually lower the roof. [SEP] building disappear days winter close architecture images roof people demolished [SEP]
[CLS] wind splashing roof bit minimize lower [SEP] or you could close the building, and the whole architecture will disappear, you know, these days, you always get images during the winter, when they take the roof down, of people who have been there and said, "they demolished the building." [SEP] disappears demolish architecture [SEP]
[CLS] building disappear days winter close architecture images roof people demolished [SEP] no, they didn't demolish it, just when it goes down, the architecture almost disappears. [SEP] working building [SEP]
[CLS] disappears demolish architecture [SEP] here's the building working. [SEP] inside person puzzled [SEP]
[CLS] working building [SEP] you see the person puzzled about what was going on inside. [SEP] wet testing water sensors open [SEP]
[CLS] inside person puzzled [SEP] and here was myself trying not to get wet, testing the sensors that open the water. [SEP] working happened night sensors stopped [SEP]
[CLS] wet testing water sensors open [SEP] well, i should tell you now what happened one night when all of the sensors stopped working. [SEP] night fun [SEP]
[CLS] working happened night sensors stopped [SEP] but actually that night, it was even more fun. [SEP] building kids zaragoza engaging [SEP]
[CLS] night fun [SEP] all the kids from zaragoza came to the building, because the way of engaging with the building became something different. [SEP] building water wet anymore open make cuts holes jump [SEP]
[CLS] building kids zaragoza engaging [SEP] not anymore a building that would open up to let you in, but a building that would still make cuts and holes through the water, and you had to jump without getting wet. [SEP] interesting architects engineers designers design people things [SEP]
[CLS] building water wet anymore open make cuts holes jump [SEP] and that was, for us, was very interesting, because, as architects, as engineers, as designers, we always think about how people will use the things we design. [SEP] unpredictable reality [SEP]
[CLS] interesting architects engineers designers design people things [SEP] but then reality's always unpredictable. [SEP] people beauty things interact [SEP]
[CLS] unpredictable reality [SEP] and that's the beauty of doing things that are used and interact with people. [SEP] pixels water image building physical made projections [SEP]
[CLS] people beauty things interact [SEP] here is an image then of the building with the physical pixels, the pixels made of water, and then projections on them. [SEP] led project show [SEP]
[CLS] pixels water image building physical made projections [SEP] and this is what led us to think about the following project i'll show you now. [SEP] imagine flying pixels start [SEP]
[CLS] led project show [SEP] that's, imagine those pixels could actually start flying. [SEP] move small imagine air lights space helicopters pixel changing cloud [SEP]
[CLS] imagine flying pixels start [SEP] imagine you could have small helicopters that move in the air, and then each of them with a small pixel in changing lights -- almost as a cloud that can move in space. [SEP] video [SEP]
[CLS] move small imagine air lights space helicopters pixel changing cloud [SEP] here is the video. [SEP] helicopter moving synchrony imagine [SEP]
[CLS] video [SEP] so imagine one helicopter, like the one we saw before, moving with others, in synchrony. [SEP] cloud [SEP]
[CLS] helicopter moving synchrony imagine [SEP] so you can have this cloud. [SEP] display dimensions kind flexible screen regular configuration [SEP]
[CLS] cloud [SEP] you can have a kind of flexible screen or display, like this -- a regular configuration in two dimensions. [SEP] regular dimensions light position thing pixels' [SEP]
[CLS] display dimensions kind flexible screen regular configuration [SEP] or in regular, but in three dimensions, where the thing that changes is the light, not the pixels' position. [SEP] type play [SEP]
[CLS] regular dimensions light position thing pixels' [SEP] you can play with a different type. [SEP] imagine sizes resolution screen scales types [SEP]
[CLS] type play [SEP] imagine your screen could just appear in different scales or sizes, different types of resolution. [SEP] cloud directions thing pixels approach move [SEP]
[CLS] imagine sizes resolution screen scales types [SEP] but then the whole thing can be just a 3d cloud of pixels that you can approach and move through it and see from many, many directions. [SEP] real flyfire control form regular grid [SEP]
[CLS] cloud directions thing pixels approach move [SEP] here is the real flyfire control and going down to form the regular grid as before. [SEP] light turn [SEP]
[CLS] real flyfire control form regular grid [SEP] when you turn on the light, actually you see this. so the same as we saw before. [SEP] people imagine controlled [SEP]
[CLS] light turn [SEP] and imagine each of them then controlled by people. [SEP] people movement pixel input [SEP]
[CLS] people imagine controlled [SEP] you can have each pixel having an input that comes from people, from people's movement, or so and so. [SEP] time show [SEP]
[CLS] people movement pixel input [SEP] i want to show you something here for the first time. [SEP] bolle dancers milan flyfire working roberto today top ballet étoile [SEP]
[CLS] time show [SEP] we've been working with roberto bolle, one of today's top ballet dancers -- the étoile at metropolitan in new york and la scala in milan -- and actually captured his movement in 3d in order to use it as an input for flyfire. [SEP] dancing roberto [SEP]
[CLS] bolle dancers milan flyfire working roberto today top ballet étoile [SEP] and here you can see roberto dancing. [SEP] pixels captured left resolutions [SEP]
[CLS] dancing roberto [SEP] you see on the left the pixels, the different resolutions being captured. [SEP] scanning capture real time motion [SEP]
[CLS] pixels captured left resolutions [SEP] it's both 3d scanning in real time and motion capture. [SEP] movement reconstruct [SEP]
[CLS] scanning capture real time motion [SEP] so you can reconstruct a whole movement. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] movement reconstruct [SEP] you can go all the way through. [SEP] play pixels rotation color movement gravity [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] but then, once we have the pixels, then you can play with them and play with color and movement and gravity and rotation. [SEP] flyfire inputs [SEP]
[CLS] play pixels rotation color movement gravity [SEP] so we want to use this as one of the possible inputs for flyfire. [SEP] wanted show project working [SEP]
[CLS] flyfire inputs [SEP] i wanted to show you the last project we are working on. [SEP] olympics working london [SEP]
[CLS] wanted show project working [SEP] it's something we're working on for the london olympics. [SEP] cloud called [SEP]
[CLS] olympics working london [SEP] it's called the cloud. [SEP] imagine raising environment cloud idea involve people changing impart call [SEP]
[CLS] cloud called [SEP] and the idea here is, imagine, again, we can involve people in doing something and changing our environment -- almost to impart what we call cloud raising -- like barn raising, but with a cloud. [SEP] imagine pixel make small donation [SEP]
[CLS] imagine raising environment cloud idea involve people changing impart call [SEP] imagine you can have everybody make a small donation for one pixel. [SEP] past couple decades remarkable happened years physical world digital [SEP]
[CLS] imagine pixel make small donation [SEP] and i think what is remarkable that has happened over the past couple of years is that, over the past couple of decades, we went from the physical world to the digital one. [SEP] knowledge internet digitizing making accessible [SEP]
[CLS] past couple decades remarkable happened years physical world digital [SEP] this has been digitizing everything, knowledge, and making that accessible through the internet. [SEP] today time world networks obama campaign showed digital self-organizing power [SEP]
[CLS] knowledge internet digitizing making accessible [SEP] now today, for the first time -- and the obama campaign showed us this -- we can go from the digital world, from the self-organizing power of networks, to the physical one. [SEP] case symbol designing [SEP]
[CLS] today time world networks obama campaign showed digital self-organizing power [SEP] this can be, in our case, we want to use it for designing and doing a symbol. [SEP] city built [SEP]
[CLS] case symbol designing [SEP] that means something built in a city. [SEP] emissions challenges tomorrow order tackle today pressing climate change digital [SEP]
[CLS] city built [SEP] but tomorrow it can be, in order to tackle today's pressing challenges -- think about climate change or co2 emissions -- how we can go from the digital world to the physical one. [SEP] collectively idea involve people thing [SEP]
[CLS] emissions challenges tomorrow order tackle today pressing climate change digital [SEP] so the idea that we can actually involve people in doing this thing together, collectively. [SEP] cloud made pixels particles real [SEP]
[CLS] collectively idea involve people thing [SEP] the cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels, in the same way as the real cloud is a cloud made of particles. [SEP] water pixels cloud particles [SEP]
[CLS] cloud made pixels particles real [SEP] and those particles are water, where our cloud is a cloud of pixels. [SEP] london pixels physical structure covered [SEP]
[CLS] water pixels cloud particles [SEP] it's a physical structure in london, but covered with pixels. [SEP] inside experiences move types [SEP]
[CLS] london pixels physical structure covered [SEP] you can move inside, have different types of experiences. [SEP] underneath sharing community main moments olympics connect [SEP]
[CLS] inside experiences move types [SEP] you can actually see from underneath, sharing the main moments for the olympics in 2012 and beyond, and really using it as a way to connect with the community. [SEP] top mountaintop physical cloud sky london [SEP]
[CLS] underneath sharing community main moments olympics connect [SEP] so both the physical cloud in the sky and something you can go to the top [of], like london's new mountaintop. [SEP] enter inside [SEP]
[CLS] top mountaintop physical cloud sky london [SEP] you can enter inside it. [SEP] night importantly top kind digital beacon type experience [SEP]
[CLS] enter inside [SEP] and a kind of new digital beacon for the night -- but most importantly, a new type of experience for anybody who will go to the top. [SEP]  [SEP]

[CLS]  [SEP] as an artist, connection is very important to me. [SEP] interconnected work articulate humans separate nature [SEP]
[CLS] artist connection important [SEP] through my work i'm trying to articulate that humans are not separate from nature and that everything is interconnected. [SEP] years ago icebergs antarctica [SEP]
[CLS] interconnected work articulate humans separate nature [SEP] i first went to antarctica almost 10 years ago, where i saw my first icebergs. [SEP] awe [SEP]
[CLS] years ago icebergs antarctica [SEP] i was in awe. [SEP] fast dizzy heart beat head comprehend stood front [SEP]
[CLS] awe [SEP] my heart beat fast, my head was dizzy, trying to comprehend what it was that stood in front of me. [SEP] feet water snowflake year icebergs top [SEP]
[CLS] fast dizzy heart beat head comprehend stood front [SEP] the icebergs around me were almost 200 feet out of the water, and i could only help but wonder that this was one snowflake on top of another snowflake, year after year. [SEP] icebergs shelves born calve glaciers break ice [SEP]
[CLS] feet water snowflake year icebergs top [SEP] icebergs are born when they calve off of glaciers or break off of ice shelves. [SEP] personality iceberg individual [SEP]
[CLS] icebergs shelves born calve glaciers break ice [SEP] each iceberg has its own individual personality. [SEP] experiences distinct interacting environment [SEP]
[CLS] personality iceberg individual [SEP] they have a distinct way of interacting with their environment and their experiences. [SEP] end passion refuse give hold bitter anymore crumble fit dramatic [SEP]
[CLS] experiences distinct interacting environment [SEP] some refuse to give up and hold on to the bitter end, while others can't take it anymore and crumble in a fit of dramatic passion. [SEP] iceberg isolated easy separate humans view [SEP]
[CLS] end passion refuse give hold bitter anymore crumble fit dramatic [SEP] it's easy to think, when you look at an iceberg, that they're isolated, that they're separate and alone, much like we as humans sometimes view ourselves. [SEP] reality [SEP]
[CLS] iceberg isolated easy separate humans view [SEP] but the reality is far from it. [SEP] melts atmosphere iceberg breathing ancient [SEP]
[CLS] reality [SEP] as an iceberg melts, i am breathing in its ancient atmosphere. [SEP] melts life iceberg releasing mineral-rich fresh water nourishes forms [SEP]
[CLS] melts atmosphere iceberg breathing ancient [SEP] as the iceberg melts, it is releasing mineral-rich fresh water that nourishes many forms of life. [SEP] exist ancestors knowing approach photographing icebergs making portraits individual moments [SEP]
[CLS] melts life iceberg releasing mineral-rich fresh water nourishes forms [SEP] i approach photographing these icebergs as if i'm making portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these individual moments they exist in that way and will never exist that way again. [SEP] melt end life death continuation path cycle [SEP]
[CLS] exist ancestors knowing approach photographing icebergs making portraits individual moments [SEP] it is not a death when they melt; it is not an end, but a continuation of their path through the cycle of life. [SEP] young ice icebergs photograph couple thousand years [SEP]
[CLS] melt end life death continuation path cycle [SEP] some of the ice in the icebergs that i photograph is very young -- a couple thousand years old. [SEP] years ice [SEP]

[CLS] eyes [SEP] i was exposed to him. [SEP] animation world company design graffiti intricate part admire respect art [SEP]
[CLS] exposed [SEP] i have a company that does design and animation, so obviously graffiti is definitely an intricate part of what we admire and respect in the art world. [SEP] tempt tony decided sponsor [SEP]
[CLS] animation world company design graffiti intricate part admire respect art [SEP] and so we decided that we were going to sponsor tony, tempt, and his cause. [SEP] money met brother father give [SEP]
[CLS] tempt tony decided sponsor [SEP] so i went and met with his brother and father and said, "we're going to give you this money. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] money met brother father give [SEP] what are you going to do with it? " [SEP] brother talk tony [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] and his brother said, "i just want to be able to talk to tony again. [SEP] communicate wait hawking devices stephen paralyzed people ability [SEP]
[CLS] brother talk tony [SEP] i just want to be able to communicate with him and i said, "wait a second, isn't that -- i've seen stephen hawking -- don't all paralyzed people have the ability to communicate via these devices?" [SEP] insurance upper echelon amazing [SEP]
[CLS] communicate wait hawking devices stephen paralyzed people ability [SEP] and he said, "no, unless you're in the upper echelon and you've got really amazing insurance, you can't actually do that. [SEP] people devices accessible [SEP]
[CLS] insurance upper echelon amazing [SEP] these devices aren't accessible to people. " [SEP] communicate [SEP]
[CLS] people devices accessible [SEP] and i said, "well, how do you actually communicate?" [SEP] movie butterfly diving bell [SEP]
[CLS] communicate [SEP] has everyone seen the movie "the diving bell and the butterfly?" [SEP] communicate run finger [SEP]
[CLS] movie butterfly diving bell [SEP] that's how they communicate -- so run their finger along. [SEP] archaic [SEP]
[CLS] communicate run finger [SEP] i said, "that's archaic. how can that be?" [SEP] check cash showed desire write wrote freaking idea [SEP]
[CLS] archaic [SEP] so i showed up with the desire to just write a check, and instead, i wrote a check that i had no freaking idea how i was going to cash. [SEP] deal tony speak machine committed brother father figure art [SEP]
[CLS] check cash showed desire write wrote freaking idea [SEP] i committed to his brother and his father right then and there -- i'm like, "all right, here's the deal: tony's going to speak, we're going to get him a machine, and we're going to figure out a way for him to do his art again. [SEP] travesty communicate [SEP]
[CLS] deal tony speak machine committed brother father figure art [SEP] because it's a travesty that someone who still has all of that in him isn't able to communicate it. " [SEP] spoke conference couple months [SEP]
[CLS] travesty communicate [SEP] so i spoke at a conference a couple months after that. [SEP] grl graffiti lab pointer draw space met guys called research [SEP]
[CLS] spoke conference couple months [SEP] i met these guys called grl, graffiti research lab, and they have a technology that allows them to project a light onto any surface and then, with a laser pointer, draw on it, and it just registers the negative space. [SEP] art installations [SEP]
[CLS] grl graffiti lab pointer draw space met guys called research [SEP] so they go around and do art installations like this. [SEP] cycle things life [SEP]
[CLS] art installations [SEP] all the things that go up there, they said there's a life cycle. [SEP] starts organs words art sexual cuss bush slanders people [SEP]
[CLS] cycle things life [SEP] first it starts with the sexual organs, then it starts with cuss words, then it was bush slanders and then people actually got to art. [SEP] presentations life cycle [SEP]
[CLS] starts organs words art sexual cuss bush slanders people [SEP] but there was always a life cycle to their presentations. [SEP] home dinner wife telling wait control things technology exists eyes [SEP]
[CLS] presentations life cycle [SEP] so i went home and was having dinner with my wife and was telling her about this, and we were like, "well wait a second. if we know that this technology exists where you can use your eyes to control things, why don't we figure out a way for tempt to control a laser and he could do graf again? well that would be awesome." [SEP] journey started [SEP]
[CLS] home dinner wife telling wait control things technology exists eyes [SEP] so that started the journey. [SEP] bunch things organization moving accomplished couple years year [SEP]
[CLS] journey started [SEP] and about two years later, about a year later, after a bunch of organization and a bunch of moving things around, we'd accomplished a couple things. [SEP] companies communicate machine battered doors insurance tempt stephen hawking [SEP]
[CLS] bunch things organization moving accomplished couple years year [SEP] one, we battered down the doors of the insurance companies, and we actually got tempt a machine that let him communicate -- a stephen hawking machine. [SEP] awesome [SEP]
[CLS] companies communicate machine battered doors insurance tempt stephen hawking [SEP] which was awesome. [SEP] funniest yoda worthy guy call talk email amazing [SEP]
[CLS] awesome [SEP] and he's seriously one of the funniest -- i call him yoda, because you talk to the guy, you get an email from him, and you're like, "i'm not worthy. this guy's so amazing." [SEP] world literally house thing flew programmers corner [SEP]

[CLS] armstrong december time top inventions cool twittered magazine honored [SEP] the coolest thing about this -- and this is what's completing the whole circle -- is that in april of this year, at the geffen moca in downtown los angeles, there's going to be an exhibition called "art of the streets." [SEP] banksy kaws art scene shepard fairey pretty bad-asses guys streets [SEP]
[CLS] circle year angeles called art streets coolest thing completing april [SEP] and "art of the streets" is going to have pretty much the bad-asses of the street art scene -- banksy, shepard fairey, kaws -- all of these guys will be there. [SEP] tempt show awesome pretty [SEP]
[CLS] banksy kaws art scene shepard fairey pretty bad-asses guys streets [SEP] tempt's going to be in the show, which is pretty awesome. [SEP] point make basically [SEP]
[CLS] tempt show awesome pretty [SEP] so basically this is my point: if you see something that's not possible, make it possible. [SEP] stage computer mic eyewriter point room [SEP]
[CLS] point make basically [SEP] everything in this room wasn't possible -- this stage, this computer, this mic, the eyewriter -- wasn't possible at one point. [SEP] make room [SEP]
[CLS] stage computer mic eyewriter point room [SEP] make it possible, everyone in this room. [SEP] programmer technology happen ocular recognition recognized amazing people make [SEP]
[CLS] make room [SEP] i'm not a programmer, never done anything with ocular recognition technology, but i just recognized something and associated myself with amazing people so that we could make something happen. [SEP] question single day feel [SEP]
[CLS] programmer technology happen ocular recognition recognized amazing people make [SEP] and this is the question i want everyone to ask yourself every single day when you come up with something you feel that needs to be done: if not now, then when? and if not me, then who? [SEP] guys [SEP]
[CLS] question single day feel [SEP] thank you guys. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] you know, what i do is write for children, and i'm probably america's most widely read children's author, in fact. [SEP] scientist people show [SEP]
[CLS] author fact children write america widely read [SEP] and i always tell people that i don't want to show up looking like a scientist. [SEP] farmer leathers chose [SEP]
[CLS] scientist people show [SEP] you can have me as a farmer, or in leathers, and no one has ever chose farmer. [SEP] epiphanies today talk circles [SEP]
[CLS] farmer leathers chose [SEP] i'm here today to talk to you about circles and epiphanies. [SEP] someplace epiphany find dropped [SEP]
[CLS] epiphanies today talk circles [SEP] and you know, an epiphany is usually something you find that you dropped someplace. [SEP] epiphany block [SEP]
[CLS] someplace epiphany find dropped [SEP] you've just got to go around the block to see it as an epiphany. [SEP] circle painting [SEP]
[CLS] epiphany block [SEP] that's a painting of a circle. [SEP] richard bollingbroke friend mine [SEP]
[CLS] circle painting [SEP] a friend of mine did that -- richard bollingbroke. [SEP] kind complicated circle [SEP]
[CLS] richard bollingbroke friend mine [SEP] it's the kind of complicated circle that i'm going to tell you about. [SEP] stow ohio queer circle began back high school class [SEP]
[CLS] kind complicated circle [SEP] my circle began back in the '60s in high school in stow, ohio where i was the class queer. [SEP] room life guy beaten bloody week boys' teacher saved [SEP]
[CLS] stow ohio queer circle began back high school class [SEP] i was the guy beaten up bloody every week in the boys' room, until one teacher saved my life. [SEP] lounge saved life letting bathroom teachers' [SEP]
[CLS] room life guy beaten bloody week boys' teacher saved [SEP] she saved my life by letting me go to the bathroom in the teachers' lounge. [SEP] secret [SEP]
[CLS] lounge saved life letting bathroom teachers' [SEP] she did it in secret. [SEP] years [SEP]
[CLS] secret [SEP] she did it for three years. [SEP] town [SEP]
[CLS] years [SEP] and i had to get out of town. [SEP] dollars california thumb francisco met lover found organizations ended san [SEP]
[CLS] town [SEP] i had a thumb, i had 85 dollars, and i ended up in san francisco, california -- met a lover -- and back in the '80s, found it necessary to begin work on aids organizations. [SEP] mrs ago teacher posten years phone call middle night [SEP]
[CLS] dollars california thumb francisco met lover found organizations ended san [SEP] about three or four years ago, i got a phone call in the middle of the night from that teacher, mrs. posten, who said, "i need to see you. [SEP] adults disappointed [SEP]
[CLS] mrs ago teacher posten years phone call middle night [SEP] i'm disappointed that we never got to know each other as adults. [SEP] ohio bring man found [SEP]
[CLS] adults disappointed [SEP] could you please come to ohio, and please bring that man that i know you have found by now. [SEP] cancer mention pancreatic quick [SEP]
[CLS] ohio bring man found [SEP] and i should mention that i have pancreatic cancer, and i'd like you to please be quick about this. " [SEP] cleveland day [SEP]
[CLS] cancer mention pancreatic quick [SEP] well, the next day we were in cleveland. [SEP] laughed cried hospice knew needed [SEP]
[CLS] cleveland day [SEP] we took a look at her, we laughed, we cried, and we knew that she needed to be in a hospice. [SEP] family found care watched [SEP]
[CLS] laughed cried hospice knew needed [SEP] we found her one, we got her there, and we took care of her and watched over her family, because it was necessary. [SEP] knew [SEP]
[CLS] family found care watched [SEP] it's something we knew how to do. [SEP] hands woman wanted adult turned box ashes [SEP]
[CLS] knew [SEP] and just as the woman who wanted to know me as an adult got to know me, she turned into a box of ashes and was placed in my hands. [SEP] circle closed happened epiphany talked presented [SEP]
[CLS] hands woman wanted adult turned box ashes [SEP] and what had happened was the circle had closed, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany i talked about presented itself. [SEP] life epiphany death part [SEP]
[CLS] circle closed happened epiphany talked presented [SEP] the epiphany is that death is a part of life. [SEP] life saved partner [SEP]
[CLS] life epiphany death part [SEP] she saved my life; i and my partner saved hers. [SEP] life part rest [SEP]
[CLS] life saved partner [SEP] and you know, that part of life needs everything that the rest of life does. [SEP] beauty today truth happy mentioned [SEP]
[CLS] life part rest [SEP] it needs truth and beauty, and i'm so happy it's been mentioned so much here today. [SEP] dignity love pleasure job hand things [SEP]
[CLS] beauty today truth happy mentioned [SEP] it also needs -- it needs dignity, love and pleasure, and it's our job to hand those things out. [SEP]  [SEP]

[CLS] clack imagine engine [SEP] it sounds scary. [SEP] day unique seat sitting [SEP]
[CLS] scary sounds [SEP] well i had a unique seat that day. i was sitting in 1d. [SEP] attendants talk flight [SEP]
[CLS] day unique seat sitting [SEP] i was the only one who could talk to the flight attendants. [SEP] problem looked birds hit [SEP]
[CLS] attendants talk flight [SEP] so i looked at them right away, and they said, "no problem. we probably hit some birds." [SEP] pilot turned plane [SEP]
[CLS] problem looked birds hit [SEP] the pilot had already turned the plane around, and we weren't that far. [SEP] manhattan [SEP]
[CLS] pilot turned plane [SEP] you could see manhattan. [SEP] time minutes things happened [SEP]
[CLS] manhattan [SEP] two minutes later, three things happened at the same time. [SEP] river pilot lines plane hudson [SEP]
[CLS] time minutes things happened [SEP] the pilot lines up the plane with the hudson river. [SEP] route [SEP]
[CLS] river pilot lines plane hudson [SEP] that's usually not the route. [SEP] engines turns [SEP]
[CLS] route [SEP] he turns off the engines. [SEP] sound imagine plane [SEP]
[CLS] engines turns [SEP] now imagine being in a plane with no sound. [SEP] words heard unemotional [SEP]
[CLS] sound imagine plane [SEP] and then he says three words -- the most unemotional three words i've ever heard. [SEP] brace impact [SEP]
[CLS] words heard unemotional [SEP] he says, "brace for impact." [SEP] anymore talk flight attendant [SEP]
[CLS] brace impact [SEP] i didn't have to talk to the flight attendant anymore. [SEP] eyes terror life [SEP]
[CLS] anymore talk flight attendant [SEP] i could see in her eyes, it was terror. life was over. [SEP] day share things learned [SEP]
[CLS] eyes terror life [SEP] now i want to share with you three things i learned about myself that day. [SEP] instant learned [SEP]
[CLS] day share things learned [SEP] i learned that it all changes in an instant. [SEP] wanted list life mend bucket things thought people reach fences [SEP]
[CLS] instant learned [SEP] we have this bucket list, we have these things we want to do in life, and i thought about all the people i wanted to reach out to that i didn't, all the fences i wanted to mend, all the experiences i wanted to have and i never did. [SEP] wines thought collect bad [SEP]
[CLS] wanted list life mend bucket things thought people reach fences [SEP] as i thought about that later on, i came up with a saying, which is, "i collect bad wines." [SEP] wine ready person opening [SEP]
[CLS] wines thought collect bad [SEP] because if the wine is ready and the person is there, i'm opening it. [SEP] life longer postpone [SEP]
[CLS] wine ready person opening [SEP] i no longer want to postpone anything in life. [SEP] urgency purpose life changed [SEP]
[CLS] life longer postpone [SEP] and that urgency, that purpose, has really changed my life. [SEP] wow day bridge lot regret thing learned clear george washington [SEP]
[CLS] urgency purpose life changed [SEP] the second thing i learned that day -- and this is as we clear the george washington bridge, which was by not a lot -- i thought about, wow, i really feel one real regret. [SEP] life lived good [SEP]
[CLS] wow day bridge lot regret thing learned clear george washington [SEP] i've lived a good life. [SEP] mistakes humanity [SEP]
[CLS] life lived good [SEP] in my own humanity and mistakes, i've tried to get better at everything i tried. [SEP] humanity ego [SEP]
[CLS] mistakes humanity [SEP] but in my humanity, i also allow my ego to get in. [SEP] matter regretted time wasted things people [SEP]
[CLS] humanity ego [SEP] and i regretted the time i wasted on things that did not matter with people that matter. [SEP] wife friends people thought relationship [SEP]
[CLS] matter regretted time wasted things people [SEP] and i thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people. [SEP] life reflected decided eliminate negative energy [SEP]
[CLS] wife friends people thought relationship [SEP] and after, as i reflected on that, i decided to eliminate negative energy from my life. [SEP] perfect lot [SEP]
[CLS] life reflected decided eliminate negative energy [SEP] it's not perfect, but it's a lot better. [SEP] years fight wife [SEP]
[CLS] perfect lot [SEP] i've not had a fight with my wife in two years. [SEP] great feels [SEP]
[CLS] years fight wife [SEP] it feels great. [SEP] happy longer choose [SEP]
[CLS] great feels [SEP] i no longer try to be right; i choose to be happy. [SEP] learned thing mental clock starts [SEP]
[CLS] happy longer choose [SEP] the third thing i learned -- and this is as your mental clock starts going, "15, 14, 13." [SEP] coming water [SEP]
[CLS] learned thing mental clock starts [SEP] you can see the water coming. [SEP] blow [SEP]
[CLS] coming water [SEP] i'm saying, "please blow up." [SEP] pieces documentaries thing break [SEP]
[CLS] blow [SEP] i don't want this thing to break in 20 pieces like you've seen in those documentaries. [SEP] wow dying scary coming sense [SEP]
[CLS] pieces documentaries thing break [SEP] and as we're coming down, i had a sense of, wow, dying is not scary. [SEP] lives preparing [SEP]
[CLS] wow dying scary coming sense [SEP] it's almost like we've been preparing for it our whole lives. [SEP] sad [SEP]
[CLS] lives preparing [SEP] but it was very sad. [SEP] life love [SEP]
[CLS] sad [SEP] i didn't want to go; i love my life. [SEP] thought thing sadness framed [SEP]
[CLS] life love [SEP] and that sadness really framed in one thought, which is, i only wish for one thing. [SEP] kids grow [SEP]
[CLS] thought thing sadness framed [SEP] i only wish i could see my kids grow up. [SEP] first-grader daughter talent month performance artistic [SEP]
[CLS] kids grow [SEP] about a month later, i was at a performance by my daughter -- first-grader, not much artistic talent... [SEP]  [SEP]

[CLS] bawling crying kid [SEP] and it made all the sense in the world to me. [SEP] point dots dad realized connecting thing matters life great [SEP]
[CLS] made sense world [SEP] i realized at that point, by connecting those two dots, that the only thing that matters in my life is being a great dad. [SEP] dad goal life good [SEP]
[CLS] point dots dad realized connecting thing matters life great [SEP] above all, above all, the only goal i have in life is to be a good dad. [SEP] miracle day gift dying [SEP]
[CLS] dad goal life good [SEP] i was given the gift of a miracle, of not dying that day. [SEP] gift differently future back live [SEP]
[CLS] miracle day gift dying [SEP] i was given another gift, which was to be able to see into the future and come back and live differently. [SEP] today plane change imagine challenge guys flying thing [SEP]
[CLS] gift differently future back live [SEP] i challenge you guys that are flying today, imagine the same thing happens on your plane -- and please don't -- but imagine, and how would you change? [SEP] forever waiting [SEP]
[CLS] today plane change imagine challenge guys flying thing [SEP] what would you get done that you're waiting to get done because you think you'll be here forever? [SEP] change relationships negative energy [SEP]

[CLS] change relationships negative energy [SEP] and more than anything, are you being the best parent you can? [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] parent [SEP] thank you. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] the idea behind the stuxnet computer worm is actually quite simple. [SEP] bomb iran [SEP]
[CLS] simple idea stuxnet computer worm [SEP] we don't want iran to get the bomb. [SEP] facility major asset developing nuclear weapons natanz uranium enrichment [SEP]
[CLS] bomb iran [SEP] their major asset for developing nuclear weapons is the natanz uranium enrichment facility. [SEP] systems gray boxes real-time control [SEP]
[CLS] facility major asset developing nuclear weapons natanz uranium enrichment [SEP] the gray boxes that you see, these are real-time control systems. [SEP] valves centrifuge manage compromise systems control drive speeds lot problems [SEP]
[CLS] systems gray boxes real-time control [SEP] now if we manage to compromise these systems that control drive speeds and valves, we can actually cause a lot of problems with the centrifuge. [SEP] software technology gray boxes run windows completely [SEP]
[CLS] valves centrifuge manage compromise systems control drive speeds lot problems [SEP] the gray boxes don't run windows software; they are a completely different technology. [SEP] box business manage place good windows virus notebook maintenance engineer [SEP]
[CLS] software technology gray boxes run windows completely [SEP] but if we manage to place a good windows virus on a notebook that is used by a maintenance engineer to configure this gray box, then we are in business. [SEP] stuxnet plot [SEP]
[CLS] box business manage place good windows virus notebook maintenance engineer [SEP] and this is the plot behind stuxnet. [SEP] dropper start windows [SEP]
[CLS] stuxnet plot [SEP] so we start with a windows dropper. [SEP] box damages centrifuge delayed mission accomplished payload gray iranian nuclear [SEP]
[CLS] dropper start windows [SEP] the payload goes onto the gray box, damages the centrifuge, and the iranian nuclear program is delayed -- mission accomplished. [SEP] huh easy [SEP]
[CLS] box damages centrifuge delayed mission accomplished payload gray iranian nuclear [SEP] that's easy, huh? [SEP] found [SEP]
[CLS] huh easy [SEP] i want to tell you how we found that out. [SEP] ago started research stuxnet months completely unknown purpose thing [SEP]
[CLS] found [SEP] when we started our research on stuxnet six months ago, it was completely unknown what the purpose of this thing was. [SEP] part vulnerabilities thing complex windows dropper multiple zero-day [SEP]
[CLS] ago started research stuxnet months completely unknown purpose thing [SEP] the only thing that was known is it's very, very complex on the windows part, the dropper part, used multiple zero-day vulnerabilities. [SEP] boxes systems gray real-time control [SEP]
[CLS] part vulnerabilities thing complex windows dropper multiple zero-day [SEP] and it seemed to want to do something with these gray boxes, these real-time control systems. [SEP] attention started lab project infected environment stuxnet checked thing [SEP]
[CLS] boxes systems gray real-time control [SEP] so that got our attention, and we started a lab project where we infected our environment with stuxnet and checked this thing out. [SEP] happened funny things [SEP]
[CLS] attention started lab project infected environment stuxnet checked thing [SEP] and then some very funny things happened. [SEP] sniffed stuxnet cheese eat behaved lab rat [SEP]
[CLS] happened funny things [SEP] stuxnet behaved like a lab rat that didn't like our cheese -- sniffed, but didn't want to eat. [SEP] make sense [SEP]
[CLS] sniffed stuxnet cheese eat behaved lab rat [SEP] didn't make sense to me. [SEP] cheese realized attack experimented flavors directed [SEP]
[CLS] make sense [SEP] and after we experimented with different flavors of cheese, i realized, well, this is a directed attack. [SEP] directed completely [SEP]
[CLS] cheese realized attack experimented flavors directed [SEP] it's completely directed. [SEP] found target dropper prowling actively gray box specific configuration actual [SEP]
[CLS] directed completely [SEP] the dropper is prowling actively on the gray box if a specific configuration is found, and even if the actual program code that it's trying to infect is actually running on that target. [SEP] stuxnet [SEP]
[CLS] found target dropper prowling actively gray box specific configuration actual [SEP] and if not, stuxnet does nothing. [SEP] attention clock thought started work target [SEP]
[CLS] stuxnet [SEP] so that really got my attention, and we started to work on this nearly around the clock, because i thought, "well, we don't know what the target is. [SEP] power germany plant chemical [SEP]
[CLS] attention clock thought started work target [SEP] it could be, let's say for example, a u.s. power plant, or a chemical plant in germany. [SEP] find target [SEP]
[CLS] power germany plant chemical [SEP] so we better find out what the target is soon. " [SEP] code bombs extracted decompiled attack discovered structured digital smaller bigger [SEP]
[CLS] find target [SEP] so we extracted and decompiled the attack code, and we discovered that it's structured in two digital bombs -- a smaller one and a bigger one. [SEP] information professionally engineered people insider [SEP]
[CLS] code bombs extracted decompiled attack discovered structured digital smaller bigger [SEP] and we also saw that they are very professionally engineered by people who obviously had all insider information. [SEP] attack knew bits bites [SEP]
[CLS] information professionally engineered people insider [SEP] they knew all the bits and bites that they had to attack. [SEP] operator shoe size [SEP]
[CLS] attack knew bits bites [SEP] they probably even know the shoe size of the operator. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] operator shoe size [SEP] so they know everything. [SEP] high-tech science heard dropper stuxnet complex payload rocket [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] and if you have heard that the dropper of stuxnet is complex and high-tech, let me tell you this: the payload is rocket science. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] high-tech science heard dropper stuxnet complex payload rocket [SEP] it's way above everything that we have ever seen before. [SEP] code sample actual attack [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] here you see a sample of this actual attack code. [SEP] lines code talking [SEP]
[CLS] code sample actual attack [SEP] we are talking about -- around about 15,000 lines of code. [SEP] language pretty old-style assembly [SEP]
[CLS] lines code talking [SEP] looks pretty much like old-style assembly language. [SEP] code make sense [SEP]
[CLS] language pretty old-style assembly [SEP] and i want to tell you how we were able to make sense out of this code. [SEP] system calls function [SEP]
[CLS] code make sense [SEP] so what we were looking for is, first of all, system function calls, because we know what they do. [SEP] real world targets timers data structures relate potential [SEP]
[CLS] system calls function [SEP] and then we were looking for timers and data structures and trying to relate them to the real world -- to potential real world targets. [SEP] disprove target theories prove [SEP]
[CLS] real world targets timers data structures relate potential [SEP] so we do need target theories that we can prove or disprove. [SEP] target theories sabotage iran reported order remember hardcore high-value located [SEP]
[CLS] disprove target theories prove [SEP] in order to get target theories, we remember that it's definitely hardcore sabotage, it must be a high-value target and it is most likely located in iran, because that's where most of the infections had been reported. [SEP] area find thousand targets [SEP]
[CLS] target theories sabotage iran reported order remember hardcore high-value located [SEP] now you don't find several thousand targets in that area. [SEP] plant basically boils bushehr nuclear power natanz fuel enrichment [SEP]
[CLS] area find thousand targets [SEP] it basically boils down to the bushehr nuclear power plant and to the natanz fuel enrichment plant. [SEP] assistant base told list centrifuge power plant experts client [SEP]
[CLS] plant basically boils bushehr nuclear power natanz fuel enrichment [SEP] so i told my assistant, "get me a list of all centrifuge and power plant experts from our client base." [SEP] data phoned picked brain effort match expertise found code [SEP]
[CLS] assistant base told list centrifuge power plant experts client [SEP] and i phoned them up and picked their brain in an effort to match their expertise with what we found in code and data. [SEP] worked pretty [SEP]
[CLS] data phoned picked brain effort match expertise found code [SEP] and that worked pretty well. [SEP] control associate small digital warhead rotor [SEP]
[CLS] worked pretty [SEP] so we were able to associate the small digital warhead with the rotor control. [SEP] centrifuge rotor moving part black object [SEP]
[CLS] control associate small digital warhead rotor [SEP] the rotor is that moving part within the centrifuge, that black object that you see. [SEP] rotor explode manipulate speed crack eventually centrifuge [SEP]
[CLS] centrifuge rotor moving part black object [SEP] and if you manipulate the speed of this rotor, you are actually able to crack the rotor and eventually even have the centrifuge explode. [SEP] creepy crazy quickly goal attack slowly effort drive maintenance engineers [SEP]
[CLS] rotor explode manipulate speed crack eventually centrifuge [SEP] what we also saw is that the goal of the attack was really to do it slowly and creepy -- obviously in an effort to drive maintenance engineers crazy, that they would not be able to figure this out quickly. [SEP] warhead structures data big digital shot closely [SEP]
[CLS] creepy crazy quickly goal attack slowly effort drive maintenance engineers [SEP] the big digital warhead -- we had a shot at this by looking very closely at data and data structures. [SEP] number code stands overlook [SEP]
[CLS] warhead structures data big digital shot closely [SEP] so for example, the number 164 really stands out in that code; you can't overlook it. [SEP] holds centrifuges cascade started research scientific literature built natanz found [SEP]
[CLS] number code stands overlook [SEP] i started to research scientific literature on how these centrifuges are actually built in natanz and found they are structured in what is called a cascade, and each cascade holds 164 centrifuges. [SEP] sense match made [SEP]
[CLS] holds centrifuges cascade started research scientific literature built natanz found [SEP] so that made sense, that was a match. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] sense match made [SEP] and it even got better. [SEP] stages called centrifuges iran subdivided [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] these centrifuges in iran are subdivided into 15, what is called, stages. [SEP] code guess found attack [SEP]
[CLS] stages called centrifuges iran subdivided [SEP] and guess what we found in the attack code? [SEP] structure identical [SEP]
[CLS] code guess found attack [SEP] an almost identical structure. [SEP] match real good [SEP]
[CLS] structure identical [SEP] so again, that was a real good match. [SEP] gave high confidence [SEP]
[CLS] match real good [SEP] and this gave us very high confidence for what we were looking at. [SEP] wrong [SEP]
[CLS] gave high confidence [SEP] now don't get me wrong here, it didn't go like this. [SEP] labor results obtained weeks hard [SEP]
[CLS] wrong [SEP] these results have been obtained over several weeks of really hard labor. [SEP] recover dead end [SEP]
[CLS] labor results obtained weeks hard [SEP] and we often went into just a dead end and had to recover. [SEP] target angles figured digital warheads aiming [SEP]
[CLS] recover dead end [SEP] anyway, so we figured out that both digital warheads were actually aiming at one and the same target, but from different angles. [SEP] warhead valves small taking spinning rotors slowing big talking manipulating [SEP]
[CLS] target angles figured digital warheads aiming [SEP] the small warhead is taking one cascade, and spinning up the rotors and slowing them down, and the big warhead is talking to six cascades and manipulating valves. [SEP] confident determined target [SEP]
[CLS] warhead valves small taking spinning rotors slowing big talking manipulating [SEP] so in all, we are very confident that we have actually determined what the target is. [SEP] natanz [SEP]
[CLS] confident determined target [SEP] it is natanz, and it is only natanz. [SEP] stuxnet worry targets hit [SEP]
[CLS] natanz [SEP] so we don't have to worry that other targets might be hit by stuxnet. [SEP] cool stuff knocked socks [SEP]
[CLS] stuxnet worry targets hit [SEP] here's some very cool stuff that we saw -- really knocked my socks off. [SEP] box centrifuges gray top [SEP]
[CLS] cool stuff knocked socks [SEP] down there is the gray box, and on the top you see the centrifuges. [SEP] sensors code attack data input thing intercepts pressure vibration legitimate [SEP]
[CLS] box centrifuges gray top [SEP] now what this thing does is it intercepts the input values from sensors -- so for example, from pressure sensors and vibration sensors -- and it provides legitimate program code, which is still running during the attack, with fake input data. [SEP] fact stuxnet matter fake input data prerecorded [SEP]
[CLS] sensors code attack data input thing intercepts pressure vibration legitimate [SEP] and as a matter of fact, this fake input data is actually prerecorded by stuxnet. [SEP] heist video hollywood movies observation camera fed prerecorded [SEP]
[CLS] fact stuxnet matter fake input data prerecorded [SEP] so it's just like from the hollywood movies where during the heist, the observation camera is fed with prerecorded video. [SEP] huh cool [SEP]
[CLS] heist video hollywood movies observation camera fed prerecorded [SEP] that's cool, huh? [SEP] room idea fool operators control [SEP]
[CLS] huh cool [SEP] the idea here is obviously not only to fool the operators in the control room. [SEP] aggressive dangerous [SEP]
[CLS] room idea fool operators control [SEP] it actually is much more dangerous and aggressive. [SEP] system idea circumvent digital safety [SEP]
[CLS] aggressive dangerous [SEP] the idea is to circumvent a digital safety system. [SEP] digital safety systems human operator act quick [SEP]
[CLS] system idea circumvent digital safety [SEP] we need digital safety systems where a human operator could not act quick enough. [SEP] plant speed millisecond power big steam turbine open relief valves [SEP]
[CLS] digital safety systems human operator act quick [SEP] so for example, in a power plant, when your big steam turbine gets too over speed, you must open relief valves within a millisecond. [SEP] operator human [SEP]
[CLS] plant speed millisecond power big steam turbine open relief valves [SEP] obviously, this cannot be done by a human operator. [SEP] systems digital safety [SEP]
[CLS] operator human [SEP] so this is where we need digital safety systems. [SEP] compromised happen real bad things [SEP]
[CLS] systems digital safety [SEP] and when they are compromised, then real bad things can happen. [SEP] plant blow [SEP]
[CLS] compromised happen real bad things [SEP] your plant can blow up. [SEP] operators safety system notice [SEP]
[CLS] plant blow [SEP] and neither your operators nor your safety system will notice it. [SEP] scary [SEP]
[CLS] operators safety system notice [SEP] that's scary. [SEP] worse [SEP]
[CLS] scary [SEP] but it gets worse. [SEP] important [SEP]
[CLS] worse [SEP] and this is very important, what i'm going to say. [SEP] generic attack [SEP]
[CLS] important [SEP] think about this: this attack is generic. [SEP] specifics centrifuges enrichment uranium [SEP]
[CLS] generic attack [SEP] it doesn't have anything to do, in specifics, with centrifuges, with uranium enrichment. [SEP] factory work power plant automobile [SEP]
[CLS] specifics centrifuges enrichment uranium [SEP] so it would work as well, for example, in a power plant or in an automobile factory. [SEP] generic [SEP]
[CLS] factory work power plant automobile [SEP] it is generic. [SEP] attacker stick stuxnet deliver payload usb case [SEP]
[CLS] generic [SEP] and you don't have -- as an attacker -- you don't have to deliver this payload by a usb stick, as we saw it in the case of stuxnet. [SEP] spreading conventional worm technology [SEP]
[CLS] attacker stick stuxnet deliver payload usb case [SEP] you could also use conventional worm technology for spreading. [SEP] spread wide [SEP]

[CLS] spread wide [SEP] and if you do that, what you end up with is a cyber weapon of mass destruction. [SEP] face consequence [SEP]
[CLS] destruction end cyber weapon mass [SEP] that's the consequence that we have to face. [SEP] east biggest number targets attacks middle [SEP]
[CLS] face consequence [SEP] so unfortunately, the biggest number of targets for such attacks are not in the middle east. [SEP] japan united states europe [SEP]
[CLS] east biggest number targets attacks middle [SEP] they're in the united states and europe and in japan. [SEP] areas environments green target-rich [SEP]
[CLS] japan united states europe [SEP] so all of the green areas, these are your target-rich environments. [SEP] consequences face start prepare [SEP]
[CLS] areas environments green target-rich [SEP] we have to face the consequences, and we better start to prepare right now. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] consequences face start prepare [SEP] thanks. [SEP] question [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] i've got a question. [SEP] ralph widely reported people assume mossad main entity [SEP]
[CLS] question [SEP] ralph, it's been quite widely reported that people assume that mossad is the main entity behind this. [SEP] opinion [SEP]
[CLS] ralph widely reported people assume mossad main entity [SEP] is that your opinion? [SEP] hear [SEP]
[CLS] opinion [SEP] okay, you really want to hear that? [SEP] yeah [SEP]
[CLS] hear [SEP] yeah. okay. [SEP] involved israel opinion mossad leading force [SEP]
[CLS] yeah [SEP] my opinion is that the mossad is involved, but that the leading force is not israel. [SEP] superpower leading force cyber [SEP]
[CLS] involved israel opinion mossad leading force [SEP] so the leading force behind that is the cyber superpower. [SEP] fortunately states united [SEP]
[CLS] superpower leading force cyber [SEP] there is only one, and that's the united states -- fortunately, fortunately. [SEP] bigger problems [SEP]
[CLS] fortunately states united [SEP] because otherwise, our problems would even be bigger. [SEP] ralph scaring living daylights [SEP]

[CLS]  [SEP] i have spent the past few years putting myself into situations that are usually very difficult and at the same time somewhat dangerous. [SEP] difficult prison [SEP]
[CLS] dangerous spent past years putting situations difficult time [SEP] i went to prison -- difficult. [SEP] dangerous mine worked coal [SEP]
[CLS] difficult prison [SEP] i worked in a coal mine -- dangerous. [SEP] zones difficult dangerous filmed war [SEP]
[CLS] dangerous mine worked coal [SEP] i filmed in war zones -- difficult and dangerous. [SEP] spent days fun beginning middle end eating difficult dangerous [SEP]
[CLS] zones difficult dangerous filmed war [SEP] and i spent 30 days eating nothing but this -- fun in the beginning, little difficult in the middle, very dangerous in the end. [SEP] make fact career engaging interesting audience immersing seemingly horrible situations [SEP]
[CLS] spent days fun beginning middle end eating difficult dangerous [SEP] in fact, most of my career, i've been immersing myself into seemingly horrible situations for the whole goal of trying to examine societal issues in a way that make them engaging, that make them interesting, that hopefully break them down in a way that make them entertaining and accessible to an audience. [SEP] knew sponsorship coming ted talk world branding [SEP]
[CLS] make fact career engaging interesting audience immersing seemingly horrible situations [SEP] so when i knew i was coming here to do a ted talk that was going to look at the world of branding and sponsorship, i knew i would want to do something a little different. [SEP] heard ago ebay couple weeks [SEP]
[CLS] knew sponsorship coming ted talk world branding [SEP] so as some of you may or may not have heard, a couple weeks ago, i took out an ad on ebay. [SEP] messages ted talk facebook twitter gave people opportunity buy naming [SEP]
[CLS] heard ago ebay couple weeks [SEP] i sent out some facebook messages, some twitter messages, and i gave people the opportunity to buy the naming rights to my 2011 ted talk. [SEP] corporation opportunity individual for-profit non-profit title lucky chris anderson happen [SEP]
[CLS] messages ted talk facebook twitter gave people opportunity buy naming [SEP] that's right, some lucky individual, corporation, for-profit or non-profit, was going to get the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity -- because i'm sure chris anderson will never let it happen again -- to buy the naming rights to the talk you're watching right now, that at the time didn't have a title, didn't really have a lot of content and didn't really give much hint as to what the subject matter would actually be. [SEP] presents depending content face ted talk idea subject ultimately blow [SEP]
[CLS] corporation opportunity individual for-profit non-profit title lucky chris anderson happen [SEP] so what you were getting was this: your name here presents: my ted talk that you have no idea what the subject is and, depending on the content, could ultimately blow up in your face, especially if i make you or your company look stupid for doing it. [SEP] opportunity good media [SEP]
[CLS] presents depending content face ted talk idea subject ultimately blow [SEP] but that being said, it's a very good media opportunity. [SEP] talks people watch ted [SEP]
[CLS] opportunity good media [SEP] you know how many people watch these ted talks? [SEP] lot [SEP]
[CLS] talks people watch ted [SEP] it's a lot. [SEP] title working [SEP]
[CLS] lot [SEP] that's just a working title, by the way. [SEP] caveat knew buy naming [SEP]
[CLS] title working [SEP] so even with that caveat, i knew that someone would buy the naming rights. [SEP] ago certainty asked year [SEP]
[CLS] caveat knew buy naming [SEP] now if you'd have asked me that a year ago, i wouldn't have been able to tell you that with any certainty. [SEP] advertising film marketing project working examine world [SEP]
[CLS] ago certainty asked year [SEP] but in the new project that i'm working on, my new film, we examine the world of marketing, advertising. [SEP] earlier years guys put pretty horrible situations prepare ready difficult [SEP]
[CLS] advertising film marketing project working examine world [SEP] and as i said earlier, i put myself in some pretty horrible situations over the years, but nothing could prepare me, nothing could ready me, for anything as difficult or as dangerous as going into the rooms with these guys. [SEP] movie idea [SEP]
[CLS] earlier years guys put pretty horrible situations prepare ready difficult [SEP] you see, i had this idea for a movie. [SEP] placement marketing advertising product film make entire funded [SEP]
[CLS] movie idea [SEP] what i want to do is make a film all about product placement, marketing and advertising, where the entire film is funded by product placement, marketing and advertising. [SEP] called sold movie greatest [SEP]
[CLS] placement marketing advertising product film make entire funded [SEP] so the movie will be called "the greatest movie ever sold." [SEP] movie sold bottom finish end sponsor greatest top start branded [SEP]
[CLS] called sold movie greatest [SEP] so what happens in "the greatest movie ever sold," is that everything from top to bottom, from start to finish, is branded from beginning to end -- from the above-the-title sponsor that you'll see in the movie, which is brand x. [SEP] brand stadium center qualcomm staples [SEP]
[CLS] movie sold bottom finish end sponsor greatest top start branded [SEP] now this brand, the qualcomm stadium, the staples center... [SEP] forever perpetuity people married film [SEP]
[CLS] brand stadium center qualcomm staples [SEP] these people will be married to the film in perpetuity -- forever. [SEP] forever idea film explores perpetuity [SEP]
[CLS] forever perpetuity people married film [SEP] and so the film explores this whole idea -- it's what? in perpetuity, forever? [SEP] person redundant [SEP]
[CLS] forever idea film explores perpetuity [SEP] i'm a redundant person. [SEP] emphasis [SEP]
[CLS] person redundant [SEP] that was more for emphasis. [SEP] forever perpetuity [SEP]
[CLS] emphasis [SEP] it was, "in perpetuity. forever." [SEP] sponsor film brand title make sell category [SEP]
[CLS] forever perpetuity [SEP] but not only are we going to have the brand x title sponsor, but we're going to make sure we sell out every category we can in the film. [SEP] wore shoe sell greatest [SEP]
[CLS] sponsor film brand title make sell category [SEP] so maybe we sell a shoe and it becomes the greatest shoe you ever wore... [SEP] greatest sold movie courtesy car drove drink [SEP]
[CLS] wore shoe sell greatest [SEP] the greatest car you ever drove from "the greatest movie ever sold," the greatest drink you've ever had, courtesy of "the greatest movie ever sold." [SEP] life film idea showing brands part finance [SEP]
[CLS] greatest sold movie courtesy car drove drink [SEP] so the idea is, beyond just showing that brands are a part of your life, but actually get them to finance the film? [SEP] work show process [SEP]
[CLS] life film idea showing brands part finance [SEP] and actually we show the whole process of how does it work. [SEP] transparency goal film [SEP]
[CLS] work show process [SEP] the goal of this whole film is transparency. [SEP] movie thing place [SEP]
[CLS] transparency goal film [SEP] you're going to see the whole thing take place in this movie. [SEP] concept film start finish [SEP]
[CLS] movie thing place [SEP] so that's the whole concept, the whole film, start to finish. [SEP] happen love ceg make [SEP]
[CLS] concept film start finish [SEP] and i would love for ceg to help make it happen. [SEP] funny audience hear ultimate respect [SEP]
[CLS] happen love ceg make [SEP] you know it's funny, because when i first hear it, it is the ultimate respect for an audience. [SEP] receptive people [SEP]
[CLS] funny audience hear ultimate respect [SEP] i don't know how receptive people are going to be to it, though. [SEP] angle perspective connotation negative play [SEP]
[CLS] receptive people [SEP] do you have a perspective -- i don't want to use "angle" because that has a negative connotation -- but do you know how this is going to play out? [SEP] money [SEP]
[CLS] angle perspective connotation negative play [SEP] how much money does it take to do this? [SEP] million [SEP]
[CLS] money [SEP] 1.5 million. [SEP] big brands hard time meeting worth pursuing couple obvious [SEP]
[CLS] million [SEP] i think that you're going to have a hard time meeting with them, but i think it's certainly worth pursuing a couple big, really obvious brands. [SEP] idiots time film bunch blithering [SEP]
[CLS] big brands hard time meeting worth pursuing couple obvious [SEP] who knows, maybe by the time your film comes out, we look like a bunch of blithering idiots. [SEP] response [SEP]
[CLS] idiots time film bunch blithering [SEP] what do you think the response is going to be? [SEP] responses [SEP]
[CLS] response [SEP] the responses mostly will be "no." [SEP] tough sell film [SEP]
[CLS] responses [SEP] but is it a tough sell because of the film or a tough sell because of me? [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] tough sell film [SEP] jk: both. [SEP] meaning optimistic [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] ... meaning not so optimistic. [SEP] sir [SEP]
[CLS] meaning optimistic [SEP] so, sir, can you help me? i need help. [SEP]  [SEP]

[CLS] brands gotta figure [SEP] yeah. [SEP] with. people deal [SEP]
[CLS] yeah [SEP] when you look at the people you deal with.. [SEP] places [SEP]
[CLS] with. people deal [SEP] we've got some places we can go. [SEP] turn camera [SEP]
[CLS] places [SEP] turn the camera off. [SEP] meant conversation thought turn camera [SEP]
[CLS] turn camera [SEP] i thought "turn the camera off" meant, "let's have an off-the-record conversation." [SEP] turns movie [SEP]
[CLS] meant conversation thought turn camera [SEP] turns out it really means, "we want nothing to do with your movie." [SEP] disappeared companies suddenly [SEP]
[CLS] turns movie [SEP] and just like that, one by one, all of these companies suddenly disappeared. [SEP] movie wanted [SEP]
[CLS] disappeared companies suddenly [SEP] none of them wanted anything to do with this movie. [SEP] amazed [SEP]
[CLS] movie wanted [SEP] i was amazed. [SEP] project wanted absolutely [SEP]
[CLS] amazed [SEP] they wanted absolutely nothing to do with this project. [SEP] people concept advertising blown thought idea product front [SEP]
[CLS] project wanted absolutely [SEP] and i was blown away, because i thought the whole concept, the idea of advertising, was to get your product out in front of as many people as possible, to get as many people to see it as possible. [SEP] media world landscape masses today intersection fractured idea buzz-worthy delivery [SEP]
[CLS] people concept advertising blown thought idea product front [SEP] especially in today's world, this intersection of new media and old media and the fractured media landscape, isn't the idea to get that new buzz-worthy delivery vehicle that's going to get that message to the masses? [SEP] thought [SEP]
[CLS] media world landscape masses today intersection fractured idea buzz-worthy delivery [SEP] no, that's what i thought. [SEP] flaw problem idea fatal [SEP]
[CLS] thought [SEP] but the problem was, you see, my idea had one fatal flaw, and that flaw was this. [SEP] whatsoever flaw [SEP]
[CLS] flaw problem idea fatal [SEP] actually no, that was not the flaw whatsoever. [SEP] problem [SEP]
[CLS] whatsoever flaw [SEP] that wouldn't have been a problem at all. [SEP] fine [SEP]
[CLS] problem [SEP] this would have been fine. [SEP] problem image represents [SEP]
[CLS] fine [SEP] but what this image represents was the problem. [SEP] transparency google search image images [SEP]
[CLS] problem image represents [SEP] see, when you do a google image search for transparency, this is --- this is one of the first images that comes up. [SEP] roll sergey brin [SEP]
[CLS] transparency google search image images [SEP] so i like the way you roll, sergey brin. no. [SEP] problem transparency free deceit easily readily understood characterized information practices [SEP]
[CLS] roll sergey brin [SEP] this is was the problem: transparency -- free from pretense or deceit; easily detected or seen through; readily understood; characterized by visibility or accessibility of information, especially concerning business practices -- that last line being probably the biggest problem. [SEP] days hear lot transparency [SEP]
[CLS] problem transparency free deceit easily readily understood characterized information practices [SEP] you see, we hear a lot about transparency these days. [SEP] politicians president ceo [SEP]
[CLS] days hear lot transparency [SEP] our politicians say it, our president says it, even our ceo's say it. [SEP] reality suddenly [SEP]
[CLS] politicians president ceo [SEP] but suddenly when it comes down to becoming a reality, something suddenly changes. [SEP] transparency scary odd still-screaming bear [SEP]
[CLS] reality suddenly [SEP] but why? well, transparency is scary -- like that odd, still-screaming bear. [SEP] unpredictable road odd country [SEP]
[CLS] transparency scary odd still-screaming bear [SEP] it's unpredictable -- like this odd country road. [SEP] risky [SEP]
[CLS] unpredictable road odd country [SEP] and it's also very risky. [SEP] risky [SEP]
[CLS] risky [SEP] what else is risky? [SEP] eating whip entire bowl cool [SEP]
[CLS] risky [SEP] eating an entire bowl of cool whip. [SEP] risky [SEP]
[CLS] eating whip entire bowl cool [SEP] that's very risky. [SEP] story started talking companies telling wanted [SEP]
[CLS] risky [SEP] now when i started talking to companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story, and they said, "no, we want you to tell a story. [SEP] story [SEP]
[CLS] story started talking companies telling wanted [SEP] we want you to tell a story, but we just want to tell our story. " [SEP] son lie story kid father catch sort giving gave sides [SEP]
[CLS] story [SEP] see, when i was a kid and my father would catch me in some sort of a lie -- and there he is giving me the look he often gave me -- he would say, "son, there's three sides to every story. [SEP] story real [SEP]
[CLS] son lie story kid father catch sort giving gave sides [SEP] there's your story, there's my story and there's the real story. " [SEP] film story wanted real [SEP]
[CLS] story real [SEP] now you see, with this film, we wanted to tell the real story. [SEP] company years team agency knew john bond richard kirshenbaum realized [SEP]
[CLS] film story wanted real [SEP] but with only one company, one agency willing to help me -- and that's only because i knew john bond and richard kirshenbaum for years -- i realized that i would have to go on my own, i'd have to cut out the middleman and go to the companies myself with all of my team. [SEP] realize started companies problem suddenly conversations idea understanding brand universal [SEP]
[CLS] company years team agency knew john bond richard kirshenbaum realized [SEP] so what you suddenly started to realize -- or what i started to realize -- is that when you started having conversations with these companies, the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem. [SEP] friends make big giant films great hollywood independent [SEP]
[CLS] realize started companies problem suddenly conversations idea understanding brand universal [SEP] i have friends who make great big, giant hollywood films, and i have friends who make little independent films like i make. [SEP] big giant friends mine make hollywood movies reason films successful [SEP]
[CLS] friends make big giant films great hollywood independent [SEP] and the friends of mine who make big, giant hollywood movies say the reason their films are so successful is because of the brand partners that they have. [SEP] big giant movies friends make small independent films supposed compete [SEP]
[CLS] big giant friends mine make hollywood movies reason films successful [SEP] and then my friends who make small independent films say, "well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant hollywood movies?" [SEP] called sold movie greatest [SEP]
[CLS] big giant movies friends make small independent films supposed compete [SEP] and the movie is called "the greatest movie ever sold." [SEP] film specifically ban [SEP]
[CLS] called sold movie greatest [SEP] so how specifically will we see ban in the film? [SEP] time cabinet deodorant ready open medicine ban [SEP]
[CLS] film specifically ban [SEP] any time i'm ready to go, any time i open up my medicine cabinet, you will see ban deodorant. [SEP] interview anytime fresh [SEP]
[CLS] time cabinet deodorant ready open medicine ban [SEP] while anytime i do an interview with someone, i can say, "are you fresh enough for this interview? [SEP] ready nervous [SEP]
[CLS] interview anytime fresh [SEP] are you ready? you look a little nervous. [SEP] calm [SEP]
[CLS] ready nervous [SEP] i want to help you calm down. [SEP] interview put [SEP]
[CLS] calm [SEP] so maybe you should put some one before the interview. " [SEP] scents offer fabulous [SEP]
[CLS] interview put [SEP] so we'll offer one of these fabulous scents. [SEP] floral fusion paradise winds chance [SEP]
[CLS] scents offer fabulous [SEP] whether it's a "floral fusion" or a "paradise winds," they'll have their chance. [SEP] solid female roll-on stick geared male [SEP]
[CLS] floral fusion paradise winds chance [SEP] we will have them geared for both male or female -- solid, roll-on or stick, whatever it may be. [SEP] tour two-cent [SEP]
[CLS] solid female roll-on stick geared male [SEP] that's the two-cent tour. [SEP] tour answer questions give five-cent [SEP]
[CLS] tour two-cent [SEP] so now i can answer any of your questions and give you the five-cent tour. [SEP] brand smaller [SEP]
[CLS] tour answer questions give five-cent [SEP] we are a smaller brand. [SEP] movie brand talked smaller challenger [SEP]
[CLS] brand smaller [SEP] much like you talked about being a smaller movie, we're very much a challenger brand. [SEP] budgets brands [SEP]
[CLS] movie brand talked smaller challenger [SEP] so we don't have the budgets that other brands have. [SEP] remind ban things people kind interested [SEP]
[CLS] budgets brands [SEP] so doing things like this -- you know, remind people about ban -- is kind of why were interested in it. [SEP] ban words describe [SEP]
[CLS] remind ban things people kind interested [SEP] what are the words that you would use to describe ban? [SEP] ban blank [SEP]
[CLS] ban words describe [SEP] ban is blank. [SEP] question great [SEP]
[CLS] ban blank [SEP] that's a great question. [SEP] superior technology [SEP]
[CLS] question great [SEP] superior technology. [SEP] technology armpit describe putting [SEP]
[CLS] superior technology [SEP] technology's not the way you want to describe something somebody's putting in their armpit. [SEP] fresh bold talk [SEP]
[CLS] technology armpit describe putting [SEP] we talk about bold, fresh. [SEP] fresh versus positive fights wetness great word spins category odor [SEP]
[CLS] fresh bold talk [SEP] i think "fresh" is a great word that really spins this category into the positive, versus "fights odor and wetness." [SEP] fresh [SEP]
[CLS] fresh versus positive fights wetness great word spins category odor [SEP] it keeps you fresh. [SEP] freshness longer fresher times [SEP]
[CLS] fresh [SEP] how do we keep you fresher longer -- better freshness, more freshness, three times fresher. [SEP] things benefit positive [SEP]
[CLS] freshness longer fresher times [SEP] things like that that are more of that positive benefit. [SEP] corporation multi-million dollar [SEP]

[CLS] companies focus strengths focusing [SEP] most companies tend to -- and it's human nature -- to avoid things that they're not sure of, avoid fear, those elements, and you really embrace those, and you actually turn them into positives for you, and it's a neat thing to see. [SEP] brands [SEP]

[CLS] film project companies part [SEP] they wanted nothing to do with this film, mainly because they would have no control, they would have no control over the final product. [SEP] stories brand control partners relinquish wanted business mindful playful ultimately [SEP]
[CLS] control film product wanted final [SEP] but we did get 17 brand partners who were willing to relinquish that control, who wanted to be in business with someone as mindful and as playful as myself and who ultimately empowered us to tell stories that normally we wouldn't be able to tell -- stories that an advertiser would normally never get behind. [SEP] story neuromarketing marketing enabled telling film mri target desire centers [SEP]
[CLS] stories brand control partners relinquish wanted business mindful playful ultimately [SEP] they enabled us to tell the story about neuromarketing, as we got into telling the story in this film about how now they're using mri's to target the desire centers of your brain for both commercials as well as movie marketing.

[CLS] simply called zoom created power [SEP] this is "the ambassadors," based in the national gallery. [SEP] stuff send masterpieces annotate friends conversation feeling [SEP]
[CLS] ambassadors based gallery national [SEP] you can annotate the stuff, send it to your friends and really get a conversation going about what you're feeling when you go through these masterpieces. [SEP] conclusion google main thing amazing stuff [SEP]
[CLS] stuff send masterpieces annotate friends conversation feeling [SEP] so i think, in conclusion, for me, the main thing is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from google. [SEP] opinion museums [SEP]
[CLS] conclusion google main thing amazing stuff [SEP] it doesn't, in my opinion, even come from the museums. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] opinion museums [SEP] i probably shouldn't say that. [SEP] artists [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] it really comes from these artists. [SEP] humbling experience [SEP]

[CLS] humbling experience [SEP] i mean, i hope in this digital medium that we do justice to their artwork and represent it properly online. [SEP] museum biggest question asked nowadays replicate experience [SEP]
[CLS] online hope digital medium justice artwork represent properly [SEP] and the biggest question i get asked nowadays is, "did you do this to replicate the experience of going to a museum?" [SEP] answer [SEP]
[CLS] museum biggest question asked nowadays replicate experience [SEP] and the answer is no. [SEP] experience supplement [SEP]
[CLS] answer [SEP] it's to supplement the experience. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] experience supplement [SEP] and that's it. thank you. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] thank you. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] this is a representation of your brain, and your brain can be broken into two parts. [SEP] half side intuitive left logical [SEP]
[CLS] brain parts representation broken [SEP] there's the left half, which is the logical side, and then the right half, which is the intuitive. [SEP] hemisphere brain scale measure aptitude plot [SEP]
[CLS] half side intuitive left logical [SEP] and so if we had a scale to measure the aptitude of each hemisphere, then we can plot our brain. [SEP] logical completely [SEP]
[CLS] hemisphere brain scale measure aptitude plot [SEP] and for example, this would be somebody who's completely logical. [SEP] intuitive [SEP]
[CLS] logical completely [SEP] this would be someone who's entirely intuitive. [SEP] scale put brain [SEP]
[CLS] intuitive [SEP] so where would you put your brain on this scale? [SEP] extremes audience time opted people brain high aptitude hemispheres [SEP]
[CLS] scale put brain [SEP] some of us may have opted for one of these extremes, but i think for most people in the audience, your brain is something like this -- with a high aptitude in both hemispheres at the same time. [SEP] mutually exclusive [SEP]
[CLS] extremes audience time opted people brain high aptitude hemispheres [SEP] it's not like they're mutually exclusive or anything. [SEP] intuitive logical [SEP]
[CLS] mutually exclusive [SEP] you can be logical and intuitive. [SEP] people physicists ideas experimental quantum good deal logic string complex [SEP]
[CLS] intuitive logical [SEP] and so i consider myself one of these people, along with most of the other experimental quantum physicists, who need a good deal of logic to string together these complex ideas. [SEP] time work good deal intuition make experiments [SEP]
[CLS] people physicists ideas experimental quantum good deal logic string complex [SEP] but at the same time, we need a good deal of intuition to actually make the experiments work. [SEP] intuition develop stuff play [SEP]
[CLS] time work good deal intuition make experiments [SEP] how do we develop this intuition? well we like to play with stuff. [SEP] acts play develop intuition [SEP]
[CLS] intuition develop stuff play [SEP] so we go out and play with it, and then we see how it acts, and then we develop our intuition from there. [SEP] thing [SEP]
[CLS] acts play develop intuition [SEP] and really you do the same thing. [SEP] time intuition developed years thing place [SEP]
[CLS] thing [SEP] so some intuition that you may have developed over the years is that one thing is only in one place at a time. [SEP] time notion sound weird thing places born developed [SEP]
[CLS] time intuition developed years thing place [SEP] i mean, it can sound weird to think about one thing being in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this notion, you developed it. [SEP] stop remember watching kid playing car [SEP]
[CLS] time notion sound weird thing places born developed [SEP] and i remember watching a kid playing on a car stop. [SEP] toddler good falling [SEP]
[CLS] stop remember watching kid playing car [SEP] he was just a toddler and he wasn't very good at it, and he kept falling over. [SEP] lesson place bet playing car stop taught valuable large things [SEP]
[CLS] toddler good falling [SEP] but i bet playing with this car stop taught him a really valuable lesson, and that's that large things don't let you get right past them, and that they stay in one place. [SEP] world physicist great conceptual model particle [SEP]
[CLS] lesson place bet playing car stop taught valuable large things [SEP] and so this is a great conceptual model to have of the world, unless you're a particle physicist. [SEP] play physicist stops terrible model car weird particle particles [SEP]
[CLS] world physicist great conceptual model particle [SEP] it'd be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with car stops, they play with these little weird particles. [SEP] particles things walls time play find sorts weird fly places [SEP]
[CLS] play physicist stops terrible model car weird particle particles [SEP] and when they play with their particles, they find they do all sorts of really weird things -- like they can fly right through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time. [SEP] observations mechanics wrote called theory quantum [SEP]
[CLS] particles things walls time play find sorts weird fly places [SEP] and so they wrote down all these observations, and they called it the theory of quantum mechanics. [SEP] ago tiny particles physics years needed quantum mechanics describe [SEP]
[CLS] observations mechanics wrote called theory quantum [SEP] and so that's where physics was at a few years ago; you needed quantum mechanics to describe little, tiny particles. [SEP] large everyday describe objects [SEP]
[CLS] ago tiny particles physics years needed quantum mechanics describe [SEP] but you didn't need it to describe the large, everyday objects around us. [SEP] intuition sit play particles [SEP]
[CLS] large everyday describe objects [SEP] this didn't really sit well with my intuition, and maybe it's just because i don't play with particles very often. [SEP] play [SEP]
[CLS] intuition sit play particles [SEP] well, i play with them sometimes, but not very often. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] play [SEP] and i've never seen them. [SEP] particle [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] i mean, nobody's ever seen a particle. [SEP] sit logical side [SEP]
[CLS] particle [SEP] but it didn't sit well with my logical side either. [SEP] mechanics quantum particles follow made [SEP]
[CLS] sit logical side [SEP] because if everything is made up of little particles and all the little particles follow quantum mechanics, then shouldn't everything just follow quantum mechanics? [SEP] reason [SEP]
[CLS] mechanics quantum particles follow made [SEP] i don't see any reason why it shouldn't. [SEP] mechanics feel lot thing show everyday object quantum [SEP]
[CLS] reason [SEP] and so i'd feel a lot better about the whole thing if we could somehow show that an everyday object also follows quantum mechanics. [SEP] ago years set [SEP]
[CLS] mechanics feel lot thing show everyday object quantum [SEP] so a few years ago, i set off to do just that. [SEP] made [SEP]
[CLS] ago years set [SEP] so i made one. [SEP] superposition object mechanical quantum [SEP]
[CLS] made [SEP] this is the first object that you can see that has been in a mechanical quantum superposition. [SEP] chip tiny computer [SEP]
[CLS] superposition object mechanical quantum [SEP] so what we're looking at here is a tiny computer chip. [SEP] middle sort green dot [SEP]
[CLS] chip tiny computer [SEP] and you can sort of see this green dot right in the middle. [SEP] minute piece metal talking [SEP]
[CLS] middle sort green dot [SEP] and that's this piece of metal i'm going to be talking about in a minute. [SEP] object photograph [SEP]
[CLS] minute piece metal talking [SEP] this is a photograph of the object. [SEP] bit zoom center [SEP]
[CLS] object photograph [SEP] and here i'll zoom in a little bit. we're looking right there in the center. [SEP] metal big close-up piece [SEP]
[CLS] bit zoom center [SEP] and then here's a really, really big close-up of the little piece of metal. [SEP] metal board ledge chunk shaped diving sticking [SEP]
[CLS] metal big close-up piece [SEP] so what we're looking at is a little chunk of metal, and it's shaped like a diving board, and it's sticking out over a ledge. [SEP] chip made thing make computer [SEP]
[CLS] metal board ledge chunk shaped diving sticking [SEP] and so i made this thing in nearly the same way as you make a computer chip. [SEP] hours wafer clean room fresh silicon cranked big machines [SEP]
[CLS] chip made thing make computer [SEP] i went into a clean room with a fresh silicon wafer, and then i just cranked away at all the big machines for about 100 hours. [SEP] stuff machine device build make swimming pool-shaped hole underneath [SEP]
[CLS] hours wafer clean room fresh silicon cranked big machines [SEP] for the last stuff, i had to build my own machine -- to make this swimming pool-shaped hole underneath the device. [SEP] superposition device ability quantum [SEP]
[CLS] stuff machine device build make swimming pool-shaped hole underneath [SEP] this device has the ability to be in a quantum superposition, but it needs a little help to do it. [SEP] analogy give [SEP]
[CLS] superposition device ability quantum [SEP] here, let me give you an analogy. [SEP] elevator uncomfortable crowded [SEP]
[CLS] analogy give [SEP] you know how uncomfortable it is to be in a crowded elevator? [SEP] frankly things scare elevator sorts weird people board stop bother [SEP]
[CLS] elevator uncomfortable crowded [SEP] i mean, when i'm in an elevator all alone, i do all sorts of weird things, but then other people get on board and i stop doing those things because i don't want to bother them, or, frankly, scare them. [SEP] quantum mechanics inanimate objects feel [SEP]
[CLS] frankly things scare elevator sorts weird people board stop bother [SEP] so quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects feel the same way. [SEP] people room fellow passengers inanimate objects light shining wind blowing [SEP]
[CLS] quantum mechanics inanimate objects feel [SEP] the fellow passengers for inanimate objects are not just people, but it's also the light shining on it and the wind blowing past it and the heat of the room. [SEP] knew mechanically passengers wanted piece metal behave quantum kick [SEP]
[CLS] people room fellow passengers inanimate objects light shining wind blowing [SEP] and so we knew, if we wanted to see this piece of metal behave quantum mechanically, we're going to have to kick out all the other passengers. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] knew mechanically passengers wanted piece metal behave quantum kick [SEP] and so that's what we did. [SEP] lights air elevator wanted turned put vacuum sucked cooled chunk [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] we turned off the lights, and then we put it in a vacuum and sucked out all the air, and then we cooled it down now, all alone in the elevator, the little chunk of metal is free to act however it wanted. [SEP] motion measured [SEP]
[CLS] lights air elevator wanted turned put vacuum sucked cooled chunk [SEP] and so we measured its motion. [SEP] found moving weird [SEP]
[CLS] motion measured [SEP] we found it was moving in really weird ways. [SEP] vibrating bellows sitting perfectly breathing expanding contracting [SEP]
[CLS] found moving weird [SEP] instead of just sitting perfectly still, it was vibrating, and the way it was vibrating was breathing something like this -- like expanding and contracting bellows. [SEP] nudge time mechanics vibrate giving gentle make allowed quantum [SEP]
[CLS] vibrating bellows sitting perfectly breathing expanding contracting [SEP] and by giving it a gentle nudge, we were able to make it both vibrate and not vibrate at the same time -- something that's only allowed with quantum mechanics. [SEP] fantastic telling [SEP]
[CLS] nudge time mechanics vibrate giving gentle make allowed quantum [SEP] so what i'm telling you here is something truly fantastic. [SEP] time vibrating thing [SEP]
[CLS] fantastic telling [SEP] what does it mean for one thing to be both vibrating and not vibrating at the same time? [SEP] atoms [SEP]
[CLS] time vibrating thing [SEP] so let's think about the atoms. [SEP] case atoms trillions make chunk metal sitting time moving [SEP]
[CLS] atoms [SEP] so in one case: all the trillions of atoms that make up that chunk of metal are sitting still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down. [SEP] align precise times [SEP]
[CLS] case atoms trillions make chunk metal sitting time moving [SEP] now it's only at precise times when they align. [SEP] delocalized rest time [SEP]
[CLS] align precise times [SEP] the rest of the time they're delocalized. [SEP] places time atom turn entire chunk metal [SEP]
[CLS] delocalized rest time [SEP] that means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which in turn means the entire chunk of metal is in two different places. [SEP] cool [SEP]
[CLS] places time atom turn entire chunk metal [SEP] i think this is really cool. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] cool [SEP] really. [SEP] chunk difference metal check worth locking clean room years scale [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] it was worth locking myself in a clean room to do this for all those years because, check this out, the difference in scale between a single atom and that chunk of metal is about the same as the difference between that chunk of metal and you.

[CLS] time imagine multiple places [SEP] how would your consciousness handle your body being delocalized in space? [SEP] story part [SEP]
[CLS] space consciousness handle body delocalized [SEP] there's one more part to the story. [SEP] piece box warmed turned lights looked inside metal [SEP]
[CLS] story part [SEP] it's when we warmed it up, and we turned on the lights and looked inside the box, we saw that the piece metal was still there in one piece. [SEP] intuition space objects develop elevator quantum crammed tiny [SEP]
[CLS] piece box warmed turned lights looked inside metal [SEP] and so i had to develop this new intuition, that it seems like all the objects in the elevator are really just quantum objects just crammed into a tiny space. [SEP] interconnected hear lot talk quantum mechanics [SEP]
[CLS] intuition space objects develop elevator quantum crammed tiny [SEP] you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says that everything is all interconnected. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] interconnected hear lot talk quantum mechanics [SEP] well, that's not quite right. [SEP] deeper [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] it's more than that; it's deeper. [SEP] literally mechanics connections things define profound weirdness quantum [SEP]
[CLS] deeper [SEP] it's that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, literally define who you are, and that's the profound weirdness of quantum mechanics. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] literally mechanics connections things define profound weirdness quantum [SEP] thank you. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] in 2007, i decided that we needed to reconceptualize how we thought about economic development. [SEP] work residents goal family live choose handful cities competing attract [SEP]
[CLS] development decided needed reconceptualize thought economic [SEP] our new goal should be that when every family thinks about where they want to live and work, they should be able to choose between at least a handful of different cities that were all competing to attract new residents. [SEP] long goal [SEP]
[CLS] work residents goal family live choose handful cities competing attract [SEP] now we're a long way away from that goal right now. [SEP] billions people developing countries single city [SEP]
[CLS] long goal [SEP] there are billions of people in developing countries who don't have even a single city that would be willing to welcome them. [SEP] amazing thing cities worth costs build [SEP]
[CLS] billions people developing countries single city [SEP] but the amazing thing about cities is they're worth so much more than it costs to build them. [SEP] dozens hundreds cities easily supply world [SEP]
[CLS] amazing thing cities worth costs build [SEP] so we could easily supply the world with dozens, maybe hundreds, of new cities. [SEP] cities sound preposterous thought [SEP]
[CLS] dozens hundreds cities easily supply world [SEP] now this might sound preposterous to you if you've never thought about new cities. [SEP] cities substitute apartment building [SEP]
[CLS] cities sound preposterous thought [SEP] but just substitute apartment building for cities. [SEP] imagine half people wanted apartments [SEP]
[CLS] cities substitute apartment building [SEP] imagine half the people who wanted to be in apartments already had them; the other half aren't there yet. [SEP] apartments expand capacity additions existing [SEP]
[CLS] imagine half people wanted apartments [SEP] you could try and expand the capacity by doing additions on all the existing apartments. [SEP] construction run apartments surrounding areas rules avoid discomfort distractions [SEP]
[CLS] apartments expand capacity additions existing [SEP] but you know what you'd run into is those apartments and the surrounding areas have rules to avoid discomfort and the distractions of construction. [SEP] additions extremely hard [SEP]
[CLS] construction run apartments surrounding areas rules avoid discomfort distractions [SEP] so it's extremely hard to do all of those additions. [SEP] brand build building someplace apartment long rules facilitated construction [SEP]
[CLS] additions extremely hard [SEP] but you could go out someplace brand new, build a brand new apartment building, as long as the rules there were ones that facilitated construction rather than getting in the way. [SEP] charter cities proposed governments create reform zones big hold gave [SEP]
[CLS] brand build building someplace apartment long rules facilitated construction [SEP] so i proposed that governments create new reform zones big enough to hold cities and gave them a name: charter cities. [SEP] time javier honduras learned octavio thinking challenge reform [SEP]
[CLS] charter cities proposed governments create reform zones big hold gave [SEP] later i learned that at about this same time, javier and octavio were thinking about the challenge of reform in honduras. [SEP] hondurans states honduras knew year leave united wanted make people [SEP]
[CLS] time javier honduras learned octavio thinking challenge reform [SEP] they knew that about 75,000 hondurans every year would leave to go to the united states, and they wanted to ask, what could they do to make sure that those people could stay and do the same things in honduras. [SEP] embassy give rules canada point javier octavio land states jobs [SEP]
[CLS] hondurans states honduras knew year leave united wanted make people [SEP] at one point, javier said to octavio, "what if we took some of our empty land -- what if we just gave it to an embassy -- give some to the u.s. embassy; give some to the canadian embassy -- and then if people want to go work under the rules of canada or under the rules of the united states, they can go get jobs, do everything they do on those embassy grounds that they would otherwise have to go to canada or the u.s. to do?"

[CLS] honduras crisis summer wrenching constitutional [SEP] at the next regularly scheduled election, pepe lobo won in a landslide on a platform that promised reform, but reconciliation as well. [SEP] staff asked octavio chief [SEP]
[CLS] election pepe reform regularly scheduled lobo won landslide platform promised [SEP] he asked octavio to be his chief of staff. [SEP] tedglobal ready give talk [SEP]
[CLS] staff asked octavio chief [SEP] meanwhile, i was getting ready to give a talk at tedglobal. [SEP] refinement trial error testing essentials process lot user boil complicated [SEP]
[CLS] tedglobal ready give talk [SEP] through a process of refinement, trial and error, a lot of user testing, i tried to boil this complicated concept of charter city down to the bare essentials. [SEP] rules holders point importance disturb existing apartment [SEP]
[CLS] refinement trial error testing essentials process lot user boil complicated [SEP] the first point was the importance of rules, like those rules that say you can't come in and disturb all the existing apartment holders. [SEP] progress back technologies rules pay lot attention hold [SEP]
[CLS] rules holders point importance disturb existing apartment [SEP] we pay a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes technologies and rules to get progress, and it's usually the rules that hold us back. [SEP] tedtalk fall friend guatemala octavio link [SEP]
[CLS] progress back technologies rules pay lot attention hold [SEP] in the fall of 2010, a friend from guatemala sent octavio a link to the tedtalk. [SEP] javier showed [SEP]
[CLS] tedtalk fall friend guatemala octavio link [SEP] he showed it to javier. [SEP] called [SEP]
[CLS] javier showed [SEP] they called me. [SEP] country present leaders [SEP]
[CLS] called [SEP] they said, "let's present this to the leaders of our country." [SEP] miami room december met hotel conference [SEP]
[CLS] country present leaders [SEP] so in december we met in miami, in a hotel conference room. [SEP] cost valuable explain point cities [SEP]
[CLS] miami room december met hotel conference [SEP] i tried to explain this point about how valuable cities are, how much more valuable they are than they cost. [SEP] notice city dollars cases meter land slide showing valuable raw [SEP]
[CLS] cost valuable explain point cities [SEP] and i used this slide showing how valuable the raw land is in a place like new york city: notice, land that's worth thousands of dollars, in some cases, per square meter. [SEP] paul discussion pause octavio tedtalk fairly abstract point watch [SEP]
[CLS] notice city dollars cases meter land slide showing valuable raw [SEP] but it was a fairly abstract discussion, and at some point when there was a pause, octavio said, "paul, maybe we could watch the tedtalk." [SEP] charter rules terms land tedtalk laid simple city place start [SEP]
[CLS] paul discussion pause octavio tedtalk fairly abstract point watch [SEP] so the tedtalk laid out in very simple terms, a charter city is a place where you start with uninhabited land, a charter that specifies the rules that will apply there and then a chance for people to opt in, to go live under those rules or not. [SEP] project important country asked president honduras forward [SEP]
[CLS] charter rules terms land tedtalk laid simple city place start [SEP] so i was asked by the president of honduras who said that we need to do this project, this is important, this could be the way forward for our country. [SEP] asked tegucigalpa talk january fourth [SEP]
[CLS] project important country asked president honduras forward [SEP] i was asked to come to tegucigalpa and talk again on january fourth and fifth. [SEP] city big presented fact-filled lecture included slide make point create [SEP]
[CLS] asked tegucigalpa talk january fourth [SEP] so i presented another fact-filled lecture that included a slide like this, which tried to make the point that, if you want to create a lot of value in a city, it has to be very big. [SEP] denver picture outline airport built [SEP]
[CLS] city big presented fact-filled lecture included slide make point create [SEP] this is a picture of denver, and the outline is the new airport that was built in denver. [SEP] square kilometers airport covers [SEP]
[CLS] denver picture outline airport built [SEP] this airport alone covers more than 100 square kilometers. [SEP] hondurans city square kilometers persuade build start site [SEP]
[CLS] square kilometers airport covers [SEP] so i was trying to persuade the hondurans, if you build a new city, you've got to start with a site that's at least 1,000 square kilometers. [SEP] hundred-thousand acres [SEP]
[CLS] hondurans city square kilometers persuade build start site [SEP] that's more than 250 hundred-thousand acres. [SEP] politely applauded [SEP]
[CLS] hundred-thousand acres [SEP] everybody applauded politely. [SEP] attentive faces audience [SEP]
[CLS] politely applauded [SEP] the faces in the audience were very serious and attentive. [SEP] professor romer lecture tedtalk leader congress stage watch [SEP]
[CLS] attentive faces audience [SEP] the leader of the congress came up on stage and said, "professor romer, thank you very much for your lecture, but maybe we could watch the tedtalk. [SEP] laptop [SEP]
[CLS] professor romer lecture tedtalk leader congress stage watch [SEP] i've got it here on my laptop. " [SEP] tedtalk sat played [SEP]
[CLS] laptop [SEP] so i sat down, and they played the tedtalk. [SEP] essence people city offer choices [SEP]
[CLS] tedtalk sat played [SEP] and it got to the essence, which is that a new city could offer new choices for people. [SEP] honduras north choice city hundreds miles [SEP]
[CLS] essence people city offer choices [SEP] there would be a choice of a city which you could go to which could be in honduras, instead of hundreds of miles away in the north. [SEP] leaders involved choices [SEP]
[CLS] honduras north choice city hundreds miles [SEP] and it also involved new choices for leaders. [SEP] partner countries charter enforcement enforced leaders government honduras benefit set [SEP]
[CLS] leaders involved choices [SEP] because the leaders in the government there in honduras would need help from partner countries, who could benefit from partner countries who help them set up the rules in this charter and the enforcement, so everybody can trust that the charter really will be enforced. [SEP] distrust insight president lobo assurance enforcement thinking foreign investors build [SEP]
[CLS] partner countries charter enforcement enforced leaders government honduras benefit set [SEP] and the insight of president lobo was that that assurance of enforcement that i was thinking about as a way to get the foreign investors to come in and build the city could be equally important for all the different parties in honduras who had suffered for so many years from fear and distrust. [SEP] site looked [SEP]
[CLS] distrust insight president lobo assurance enforcement thinking foreign investors build [SEP] we went and looked at a site. [SEP] picture [SEP]
[CLS] site looked [SEP] this picture's from there. [SEP] kilometers easily hold thousand square [SEP]
[CLS] picture [SEP] it easily could hold a thousand square kilometers. [SEP] january regions shortly voted congress amend constitution constitutional provision special [SEP]
[CLS] kilometers easily hold thousand square [SEP] and shortly thereafter, on january 19th, they voted in the congress to amend their constitution to have a constitutional provision that allows for special development regions.

[CLS] january regions shortly voted congress amend constitution constitutional provision special [SEP] in a country which had just gone through this wrenching crisis, the vote in the congress in favor of this constitutional amendment was 124 to one. [SEP] parties society backed factions [SEP]
[CLS] crisis country wrenching vote congress favor constitutional amendment [SEP] all parties, all factions in society, backed this. [SEP] constitution congress part pass [SEP]
[CLS] parties society backed factions [SEP] to be part of the constitution, you actually have to pass it twice in the congress. [SEP] february passed vote [SEP]

[CLS] korea south [SEP] this is a picture of a big, new city center that's being built in south korea -- bigger than downtown boston. [SEP] years permits built spent [SEP]
[CLS] big korea bigger boston picture city center built south downtown [SEP] everything you see there was built in four years, after they spent four years getting the permits. [SEP] singapore place interested city building [SEP]
[CLS] years permits built spent [SEP] the other place that's very interested in city building is singapore. [SEP] built cities china preparing [SEP]
[CLS] singapore place interested city building [SEP] they've actually built two cities already in china and are preparing the third. [SEP] practically [SEP]
[CLS] built cities china preparing [SEP] so if you think about this practically, here's where we are. [SEP] city site thinking [SEP]

[CLS] store set tasting booth entrance [SEP] we there put out six different flavors of jam or 24 different flavors of jam, and we looked at two things: first, in which case were people more likely to stop, sample some jam? [SEP] percent people stopped [SEP]
[CLS] flavors jam things stop sample put looked case people [SEP] more people stopped when there were 24, about 60 percent, than when there were six, about 40 percent. [SEP] jam thing looked case people buy jar [SEP]
[CLS] percent people stopped [SEP] the next thing we looked at is in which case were people more likely to buy a jar of jam. [SEP] effect opposite [SEP]
[CLS] jam thing looked case people buy jar [SEP] now we see the opposite effect. [SEP] jam people stopped percent bought jar [SEP]
[CLS] effect opposite [SEP] of the people who stopped when there were 24, only three percent of them actually bought a jar of jam. [SEP] percent jam people stopped bought jar [SEP]
[CLS] jam people stopped percent bought jar [SEP] of the people who stopped when there were six, well now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a jar of jam. [SEP] encountered math people times buy jar jam [SEP]
[CLS] percent jam people stopped bought jar [SEP] now if you do the math, people were at least six times more likely to buy a jar of jam if they encountered six than if they encountered 24. [SEP] good waistlines decisions choosing buy jar jam turns choice overload [SEP]
[CLS] encountered math people times buy jar jam [SEP] now choosing not to buy a jar of jam is probably good for us -- at least it's good for our waistlines -- but it turns out that this choice overload problem affects us even in very consequential decisions. [SEP] self-interests choose [SEP]
[CLS] good waistlines decisions choosing buy jar jam turns choice overload [SEP] we choose not to choose, even when it goes against our best self-interests. [SEP] today financial savings topic [SEP]
[CLS] self-interests choose [SEP] so now for the topic of today: financial savings. [SEP] huberman emir kamenica wei plans describe study gur jang looked [SEP]
[CLS] today financial savings topic [SEP] now i'm going to describe to you a study i did with gur huberman, emir kamenica, wei jang where we looked at the retirement savings decisions of nearly a million americans from about 650 plans all in the u.s. [SEP] plan tomorrow looked number fund offerings retirement savings affect people [SEP]
[CLS] huberman emir kamenica wei plans describe study gur jang looked [SEP] and what we looked at was whether the number of fund offerings available in a retirement savings plan, the 401 plan, does that affect people's likelihood to save more for tomorrow. [SEP] correlation found [SEP]
[CLS] plan tomorrow looked number fund offerings retirement savings affect people [SEP] and what we found was that indeed there was a correlation. [SEP] plans ranged people fund offering offerings [SEP]
[CLS] correlation found [SEP] so in these plans, we had about 657 plans that ranged from offering people anywhere from two to 59 different fund offerings. [SEP] offered rate found funds participation [SEP]
[CLS] plans ranged people fund offering offerings [SEP] and what we found was that, the more funds offered, indeed, there was less participation rate. [SEP] extremes funds participation plans offered rates high [SEP]
[CLS] offered rate found funds participation [SEP] so if you look at the extremes, those plans that offered you two funds, participation rates were around in the mid-70s -- still not as high as we want it to be. [SEP] funds percentile participation plans offered rates dropped [SEP]
[CLS] extremes funds participation plans offered rates high [SEP] in those plans that offered nearly 60 funds, participation rates have now dropped to about the 60th percentile. [SEP] present consequences turns choose participate choices negative [SEP]
[CLS] funds percentile participation plans offered rates dropped [SEP] now it turns out that even if you do choose to participate when there are more choices present, even then, it has negative consequences. [SEP] participate funds people choose choices completely avoid stocks equity [SEP]
[CLS] present consequences turns choose participate choices negative [SEP] so for those people who did choose to participate, the more choices available, the more likely people were to completely avoid stocks or equity funds. [SEP] accounts money choices put pure market [SEP]
[CLS] participate funds people choose choices completely avoid stocks equity [SEP] the more choices available, the more likely they were to put all their money in pure money market accounts. [SEP] decisions well-being extreme kinds recommend people future financial [SEP]
[CLS] accounts money choices put pure market [SEP] now neither of these extreme decisions are the kinds of decisions that any of us would recommend for people when you're considering their future financial well-being. [SEP] decade choices past observed main negative consequences offering people [SEP]
[CLS] decisions well-being extreme kinds recommend people future financial [SEP] well, over the past decade, we have observed three main negative consequences to offering people more and more choices. [SEP] choosing procrastinate self-interest delay [SEP]
[CLS] decade choices past observed main negative consequences offering people [SEP] they're more likely to delay choosing -- procrastinate even when it goes against their best self-interest. [SEP] choices medical worse make financial [SEP]
[CLS] choosing procrastinate self-interest delay [SEP] they're more likely to make worse choices -- worse financial choices, medical choices. [SEP] satisfied choose things make objectively [SEP]
[CLS] choices medical worse make financial [SEP] they're more likely to choose things that make them less satisfied, even when they do objectively better. [SEP] mustards vinegars jams mayonnaises display main reason enjoy gazing giant [SEP]
[CLS] satisfied choose things make objectively [SEP] the main reason for this is because, we might enjoy gazing at those giant walls of mayonnaises, mustards, vinegars, jams, but we can't actually do the math of comparing and contrasting and actually picking from that stunning display. [SEP] techniques venues businesses propose today simple tested research easily apply [SEP]
[CLS] mustards vinegars jams mayonnaises display main reason enjoy gazing giant [SEP] so what i want to propose to you today are four simple techniques -- techniques that we have tested in one way or another in different research venues -- that you can easily apply in your businesses. [SEP] cut [SEP]
[CLS] techniques venues businesses propose today simple tested research easily apply [SEP] the first: cut. [SEP] today heard true [SEP]

[CLS] cut people upset [SEP] they're always worried they're going to lose shelf space. [SEP] fact cut options sales costs experience rid extraneous redundant increase [SEP]
[CLS] space worried lose shelf [SEP] but in fact, what we're seeing more and more is that if you are willing to cut, get rid of those extraneous redundant options, well there's an increase in sales, there's a lowering of costs, there is an improvement of the choosing experience.

[CLS] fund single harvard employee automatically enrolled lifecycle [SEP] for those people who actually want to choose, they're given 20 funds, not 300 or more funds. [SEP] people cut [SEP]
[CLS] funds choose people [SEP] you know, often, people say, "i don't know how to cut. [SEP] choices important [SEP]
[CLS] people cut [SEP] they're all important choices. " [SEP] employees thing choices [SEP]
[CLS] choices important [SEP] and the first thing i do is i ask the employees, "tell me how these choices are different from one another. [SEP] consumers employees [SEP]
[CLS] employees thing choices [SEP] and if your employees can't tell them apart, neither can your consumers. " [SEP] afternoon gary started session chat [SEP]
[CLS] consumers employees [SEP] now before we started our session this afternoon, i had a chat with gary. [SEP] free world gary offer people audience vacation beautiful road [SEP]
[CLS] afternoon gary started session chat [SEP] and gary said that he would be willing to offer people in this audience an all-expenses-paid free vacation to the most beautiful road in the world. [SEP] road description [SEP]
[CLS] free world gary offer people audience vacation beautiful road [SEP] here's a description of the road. [SEP] read [SEP]
[CLS] road description [SEP] and i'd like you to read it. [SEP] offer give read clap hands ready gary [SEP]
[CLS] read [SEP] and now i'll give you a few seconds to read it and then i want you to clap your hands if you're ready to take gary up on his offer. [SEP] offer ready [SEP]
[CLS] offer give read clap hands ready gary [SEP] okay. anybody who's ready to take him up on his offer. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] offer ready [SEP] is that all? [SEP] show [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] all right, let me show you some more about this. [SEP] trick guys knew [SEP]
[CLS] show [SEP] you guys knew there was a trick, didn't you. [SEP] trip ready [SEP]
[CLS] trick guys knew [SEP] now who's ready to go on this trip. [SEP] hands heard [SEP]
[CLS] trip ready [SEP] i think i might have actually heard more hands. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] hands heard [SEP] all right. [SEP] time fact objectively information venture guess felt real [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] now in fact, you had objectively more information the first time around than the second time around, but i would venture to guess that you felt that it was more real the second time around. [SEP] pictures made feel real [SEP]
[CLS] time fact objectively information venture guess felt real [SEP] because the pictures made it feel more real to you. [SEP] problem concretization brings technique handling choice overload [SEP]
[CLS] pictures made feel real [SEP] which brings me to the second technique for handling the choice overload problem, which is concretization. [SEP] understand consequences choices choice order people differences felt vivid sort [SEP]
[CLS] problem concretization brings technique handling choice overload [SEP] that in order for people to understand the differences between the choices, they have to be able to understand the consequences associated with each choice, and that the consequences need to be felt in a vivid sort of way, in a very concrete way. [SEP] percent cash card people spend average atm credit opposed [SEP]
[CLS] understand consequences choices choice order people differences felt vivid sort [SEP] why do people spend an average of 15 to 30 percent more when they use an atm card or a credit card as opposed to cash? [SEP] money feel real [SEP]
[CLS] percent cash card people spend average atm credit opposed [SEP] because it doesn't feel like real money. [SEP] turns making feel concrete positive tool people save [SEP]
[CLS] money feel real [SEP] and it turns out that making it feel more concrete can actually be a very positive tool to use in getting people to save more. [SEP] ing plan study people previtero employees shlomo benartzi alessandro working [SEP]
[CLS] turns making feel concrete positive tool people save [SEP] so a study that i did with shlomo benartzi and alessandro previtero, we did a study with people at ing -- employees that are all working at ing -- and now these people were all in a session where they're doing enrollment for their 401 plan. [SEP] thing session added [SEP]
[CLS] ing plan study people previtero employees shlomo benartzi alessandro working [SEP] and during that session, we kept the session exactly the way it used to be, but we added one little thing. [SEP] added asked people positive happen life saved thing things [SEP]
[CLS] thing session added [SEP] the one little thing we added was we asked people to just think about all the positive things that would happen in your life if you saved more. [SEP] increase amount thing percent simple enrollment people save put savings [SEP]
[CLS] added asked people positive happen life saved thing things [SEP] by doing that simple thing, there was an increase in enrollment by 20 percent and there was an increase in the amount of people willing to save or the amount that they were willing to put down into their savings account by four percent. [SEP] categorization technique [SEP]
[CLS] increase amount thing percent simple enrollment people save put savings [SEP] the third technique: categorization. [SEP] handle choices categories [SEP]
[CLS] categorization technique [SEP] we can handle more categories than we can handle choices. [SEP] aisle study magazine [SEP]
[CLS] handle choices categories [SEP] so for example, here's a study we did in a magazine aisle. [SEP] corridor turns wegmans grocery stores northeast aisles range kinds magazine [SEP]
[CLS] aisle study magazine [SEP] it turns out that in wegmans grocery stores up and down the northeast corridor, the magazine aisles range anywhere from 331 different kinds of magazines all the way up to 664. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] corridor turns wegmans grocery stores northeast aisles range kinds magazine [SEP] but you know what? [SEP] categories magazines show gave divide versus choice choosing experience [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] if i show you 600 magazines and i divide them up into 10 categories, versus i show you 400 magazines and divide them up into 20 categories, you believe that i have given you more choice and a better choosing experience if i gave you the 400 than if i gave you the 600. [SEP] categories [SEP]
[CLS] categories magazines show gave divide versus choice choosing experience [SEP] because the categories tell me how to tell them apart. [SEP] displays jewelry [SEP]
[CLS] categories [SEP] here are two different jewelry displays. [SEP] called jazz swing [SEP]
[CLS] displays jewelry [SEP] one is called "jazz" and the other one is called "swing." [SEP] display jazz clap hands left swing [SEP]
[CLS] called jazz swing [SEP] if you think the display on the left is swing and the display on the right is jazz, clap your hands. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] display jazz clap hands left swing [SEP] okay, there's some. [SEP] swing clap hands left jazz [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] if you think the one on the left is jazz and the one on the right is swing, clap your hands. [SEP] bit [SEP]
[CLS] swing clap hands left jazz [SEP] okay, a bit more. [SEP] turns [SEP]
[CLS] bit [SEP] now it turns out you're right. [SEP] swing left jazz [SEP]
[CLS] turns [SEP] the one on the left is jazz and the one on the right is swing, but you know what? [SEP] scheme highly useless categorization [SEP]
[CLS] swing left jazz [SEP] this is a highly useless categorization scheme. [SEP] chooser choice-maker categories [SEP]
[CLS] scheme highly useless categorization [SEP] the categories need to say something to the chooser, not the choice-maker. [SEP] funds problem long lists [SEP]
[CLS] chooser choice-maker categories [SEP] and you often see that problem when it comes down to those long lists of all these funds. [SEP] informing supposed [SEP]
[CLS] funds problem long lists [SEP] who are they actually supposed to be informing? [SEP] technique condition complexity fourth [SEP]
[CLS] informing supposed [SEP] my fourth technique: condition for complexity. [SEP] easier turns handle lot information [SEP]
[CLS] technique condition complexity fourth [SEP] it turns out we can actually handle a lot more information than we think we can, we've just got to take it a little easier. [SEP] complexity gradually increase [SEP]
[CLS] easier turns handle lot information [SEP] we have to gradually increase the complexity. [SEP] show talking [SEP]
[CLS] complexity gradually increase [SEP] i'm going to show you one example of what i'm talking about. [SEP] decision buying car complicated [SEP]
[CLS] show talking [SEP] let's take a very, very complicated decision: buying a car. [SEP] car german manufacturer opportunity completely custom make [SEP]
[CLS] decision buying car complicated [SEP] here's a german car manufacturer that gives you the opportunity to completely custom make your car. [SEP] decisions completely car make [SEP]
[CLS] car german manufacturer opportunity completely custom make [SEP] you've got to make 60 different decisions, completely make up your car. [SEP] vary number choices offer decisions decision [SEP]
[CLS] decisions completely car make [SEP] now these decisions vary in the number of choices that they offer per decision. [SEP] colors choices car exterior [SEP]
[CLS] vary number choices offer decisions decision [SEP] car colors, exterior car colors -- i've got 56 choices. [SEP] engines gearshift choices [SEP]
[CLS] colors choices car exterior [SEP] engines, gearshift -- four choices. [SEP] vary order decisions [SEP]
[CLS] engines gearshift choices [SEP] so now what i'm going to do is i'm going to vary the order in which these decisions appear. [SEP] choice car colors gearshifts half customers high low [SEP]
[CLS] vary order decisions [SEP] so half of the customers are going to go from high choice, 56 car colors, to low choice, four gearshifts. [SEP] choice gearshifts car colors high half customers low [SEP]
[CLS] choice car colors gearshifts half customers high low [SEP] the other half of the customers are going to go from low choice, four gearshifts, to 56 car colors, high choice. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] choice gearshifts car colors high half customers low [SEP] what am i going to look at? [SEP] engaged [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] how engaged you are. [SEP] decision overwhelmed hitting default button losing [SEP]
[CLS] engaged [SEP] if you keep hitting the default button per decision, that means you're getting overwhelmed, that means i'm losing you. [SEP] choice find people high low hitting default button [SEP]
[CLS] decision overwhelmed hitting default button losing [SEP] what you find is the people who go from high choice to low choice, they're hitting that default button over and over and over again. [SEP] losing [SEP]
[CLS] choice find people high low hitting default button [SEP] we're losing them. [SEP] choice low high hanging [SEP]
[CLS] losing [SEP] they go from low choice to high choice, they're hanging in there. [SEP] information choices number [SEP]
[CLS] choice low high hanging [SEP] it's the same information. it's the same number of choices. [SEP] presented thing varied order information [SEP]
[CLS] information choices number [SEP] the only thing that i have done is i have varied the order in which that information is presented. [SEP] easy choose start learn [SEP]
[CLS] presented thing varied order information [SEP] if i start you off easy, i learn how to choose. [SEP] decor choose choosing gearshift preferences interior prepares [SEP]
[CLS] easy choose start learn [SEP] even though choosing gearshift doesn't tell me anything about my preferences for interior decor, it still prepares me for how to choose. [SEP] engaged excited big product putting motivated [SEP]
[CLS] decor choose choosing gearshift preferences interior prepares [SEP] it also gets me excited about this big product that i'm putting together, so i'm more willing to be motivated to be engaged. [SEP] recap [SEP]
[CLS] engaged excited big product putting motivated [SEP] so let me recap. [SEP] cut concretize categorize overload alternatives make real categories condition complexity [SEP]
[CLS] recap [SEP] i have talked about four techniques for mitigating the problem of choice overload -- cut -- get rid of the extraneous alternatives; concretize -- make it real; categorize -- we can handle more categories, less choices; condition for complexity. [SEP] choices serving techniques describing today designed manage people [SEP]
[CLS] cut concretize categorize overload alternatives make real categories condition complexity [SEP] all of these techniques that i'm describing to you today are designed to help you manage your choices -- better for you, you can use them on yourself, better for the people that you are serving. [SEP] choosing key choice choosy [SEP]
[CLS] choices serving techniques describing today designed manage people [SEP] because i believe that the key to getting the most from choice is to be choosy about choosing. [SEP] choosing choosy practice art [SEP]
[CLS] choosing key choice choosy [SEP] and the more we're able to be choosy about choosing the better we will be able to practice the art of choosing. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] choosing choosy practice art [SEP] thank you very much. [SEP]  [SEP]

[CLS] matters talk bit today videos viral [SEP] we all want to be stars -- celebrities, singers, comedians -- and when i was younger, that seemed so very, very hard to do. [SEP] culture web video made creative things completely famous part world [SEP]
[CLS] celebrities singers comedians stars younger hard [SEP] but now web video has made it so that any of us or any of the creative things that we do can become completely famous in a part of our world's culture. [SEP] saturday famous internet [SEP]
[CLS] culture web video made creative things completely famous part world [SEP] any one of you could be famous on the internet by next saturday. [SEP] hours minute video uploaded youtube [SEP]

[CLS] hours minute video uploaded youtube [SEP] and of that, only a tiny percentage ever goes viral and gets tons of views and becomes a cultural moment. [SEP] happen [SEP]
[CLS] moment tiny percentage viral tons views cultural [SEP] so how does it happen? [SEP] tastemakers things communities unexpectedness participation [SEP]
[CLS] happen [SEP] three things: tastemakers, communities of participation and unexpectedness. [SEP]  [SEP]

[CLS]  [SEP] i'm here to share my photography. [SEP] photography [SEP]
[CLS] photography share [SEP] or is it photography? [SEP] camera photograph [SEP]
[CLS] photography [SEP] because, of course, this is a photograph that you can't take with your camera. [SEP] interest photography started digital camera age [SEP]
[CLS] camera photograph [SEP] yet, my interest in photography started as i got my first digital camera at the age of 15. [SEP] drawing camera mixed earlier passion bit process planning [SEP]
[CLS] interest photography started digital camera age [SEP] it mixed with my earlier passion for drawing, but it was a bit different, because using the camera, the process was in the planning instead. [SEP] camera trigger photograph process ends press [SEP]
[CLS] drawing camera mixed earlier passion bit process planning [SEP] and when you take a photograph with a camera, the process ends when you press the trigger. [SEP] time felt photography place [SEP]
[CLS] camera trigger photograph process ends press [SEP] so to me it felt like photography was more about being at the right place and the right time. [SEP] felt [SEP]
[CLS] time felt photography place [SEP] i felt like anyone could do that. [SEP] trigger wanted create process starts press [SEP]
[CLS] felt [SEP] so i wanted to create something different, something where the process starts when you press the trigger. [SEP] photos construction road busy [SEP]
[CLS] trigger wanted create process starts press [SEP] photos like this: construction going on along a busy road. [SEP] twist unexpected [SEP]
[CLS] photos construction road busy [SEP] but it has an unexpected twist. [SEP] realism retains level [SEP]
[CLS] twist unexpected [SEP] and despite that, it retains a level of realism. [SEP] colorful realism photos dark common goal retaining level [SEP]
[CLS] realism retains level [SEP] or photos like these -- both dark and colorful, but all with a common goal of retaining the level of realism. [SEP] realism photo-realism [SEP]
[CLS] colorful realism photos dark common goal retaining level [SEP] when i say realism, i mean photo-realism. [SEP] photograph capture captured [SEP]
[CLS] realism photo-realism [SEP] because, of course, it's not something you can capture really, but i always want it to look like it could have been captured somehow as a photograph. [SEP] photos trick moment figure [SEP]
[CLS] photograph capture captured [SEP] photos where you will need a brief moment to think to figure out the trick. [SEP] capturing idea moment [SEP]
[CLS] photos trick moment figure [SEP] so it's more about capturing an idea than about capturing a moment really. [SEP] realistic trick makes [SEP]
[CLS] capturing idea moment [SEP] but what's the trick that makes it look realistic? [SEP] colors details [SEP]
[CLS] realistic trick makes [SEP] is it something about the details or the colors? [SEP] light [SEP]
[CLS] colors details [SEP] is it something about the light? [SEP] illusion creates [SEP]
[CLS] light [SEP] what creates the illusion? [SEP] illusion perspective [SEP]
[CLS] illusion creates [SEP] sometimes the perspective is the illusion. [SEP] end surface interpret world realized two-dimensional [SEP]
[CLS] illusion perspective [SEP] but in the end, it comes down to how we interpret the world and how it can be realized on a two-dimensional surface. [SEP] realistic [SEP]
[CLS] end surface interpret world realized two-dimensional [SEP] it's not really what is realistic, it's what we think looks realistic really. [SEP] simple basics [SEP]
[CLS] realistic [SEP] so i think the basics are quite simple. [SEP] reality puzzle pieces put create alternate [SEP]
[CLS] simple basics [SEP] i just see it as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together to create alternate reality. [SEP] show simple [SEP]
[CLS] reality puzzle pieces put create alternate [SEP] and let me show you a simple example. [SEP] objects world perfectly imaginable physical relate living three-dimensional [SEP]
[CLS] show simple [SEP] here we have three perfectly imaginable physical objects, something we all can relate to living in a three-dimensional world. [SEP] three-dimensional exist combined create [SEP]
[CLS] objects world perfectly imaginable physical relate living three-dimensional [SEP] but combined in a certain way, they can create something that still looks three-dimensional, like it could exist. [SEP] time [SEP]
[CLS] three-dimensional exist combined create [SEP] but at the same time, we know it can't. [SEP] sense trick simply accept fact make brains brain [SEP]
[CLS] time [SEP] so we trick our brains, because our brain simply doesn't accept the fact that it doesn't really make sense. [SEP] photographs process combining [SEP]
[CLS] sense trick simply accept fact make brains brain [SEP] and i see the same process with combining photographs. [SEP] realities combining [SEP]
[CLS] photographs process combining [SEP] it's just really about combining different realities. [SEP] things realistic lives make photograph daily [SEP]
[CLS] realities combining [SEP] so the things that make a photograph look realistic, i think it's the things that we don't even think about, the things all around us in our daily lives. [SEP] photographs combining important wrong [SEP]
[CLS] things realistic lives make photograph daily [SEP] but when combining photographs, this is really important to consider, because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow. [SEP] result simple rules follow achieve realistic [SEP]
[CLS] photographs combining important wrong [SEP] so i would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a realistic result. [SEP] special images [SEP]
[CLS] result simple rules follow achieve realistic [SEP] as you can see, these images aren't really special. [SEP] combined create [SEP]
[CLS] special images [SEP] but combined, they can create something like this. [SEP] perspective rule photos combined [SEP]
[CLS] combined create [SEP] so the first rule is that photos combined should have the same perspective. [SEP] photos light combined type [SEP]
[CLS] perspective rule photos combined [SEP] secondly, photos combined should have the same type of light. [SEP] requirements shot light images fulfill height type [SEP]
[CLS] photos light combined type [SEP] and these two images both fulfill these two requirements -- shot at the same height and in the same type of light. [SEP] making seamless impossible distinguish images begin end [SEP]
[CLS] requirements shot light images fulfill height type [SEP] the third one is about making it impossible to distinguish where the different images begin and end by making it seamless. [SEP] make composed impossible image [SEP]
[CLS] making seamless impossible distinguish images begin end [SEP] make it impossible to say how the image actually was composed. [SEP] borders images image contrast adding field desaturated noise basically matching [SEP]
[CLS] make composed impossible image [SEP] so by matching color, contrast and brightness in the borders between the different images, adding photographic defects like depth of field, desaturated colors and noise, we erase the borders between the different images and make it look like one single image, despite the fact that one image can contain hundreds of layers basically. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] borders images image contrast adding field desaturated noise basically matching [SEP] so here's another example. [SEP] manipulated image landscape lower part [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] one might think that this is just an image of a landscape and the lower part is what's manipulated. [SEP] locations image composed photographs [SEP]
[CLS] manipulated image landscape lower part [SEP] but this image is actually entirely composed of photographs from different locations. [SEP] place head personally easier create find compromise ideas [SEP]
[CLS] locations image composed photographs [SEP] i personally think that it's easier to actually create a place than to find a place, because then you don't need to compromise with the ideas in your head. [SEP] planning require lot [SEP]
[CLS] place head personally easier create find compromise ideas [SEP] but it does require a lot of planning. [SEP] winter basically idea knew months plan find locations pieces puzzle [SEP]
[CLS] planning require lot [SEP] and getting this idea during winter, i knew that i had several months to plan it, to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle basically. [SEP] trip fish captured fishing [SEP]
[CLS] winter basically idea knew months plan find locations pieces puzzle [SEP] so for example, the fish was captured on a fishing trip. [SEP] location shores [SEP]
[CLS] trip fish captured fishing [SEP] the shores are from a different location. [SEP] pit underwater part captured stone [SEP]
[CLS] location shores [SEP] the underwater part was captured in a stone pit. [SEP] yeah swedish turned house top island red make [SEP]
[CLS] pit underwater part captured stone [SEP] and yeah, i even turned the house on top of the island red to make it look more swedish. [SEP] result planning achieve realistic [SEP]
[CLS] yeah swedish turned house top island red make [SEP] so to achieve a realistic result, i think it comes down to planning. [SEP] sketch idea starts [SEP]
[CLS] result planning achieve realistic [SEP] it always starts with a sketch, an idea. [SEP] photographs combining [SEP]
[CLS] sketch idea starts [SEP] then it's about combining the different photographs. [SEP] planned piece [SEP]
[CLS] photographs combining [SEP] and here every piece is very well planned. [SEP] photos realistic good job capturing result beautiful [SEP]
[CLS] planned piece [SEP] and if you do a good job capturing the photos, the result can be quite beautiful and also quite realistic. [SEP] imagination tools thing limits [SEP]
[CLS] photos realistic good job capturing result beautiful [SEP] so all the tools are out there, and the only thing that limits us is our imagination. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] imagination tools thing limits [SEP] thank you. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] i would like to talk to you about why many e-health projects fail. [SEP] patients important thing stopped listening [SEP]
[CLS] fail talk e-health projects [SEP] and i really think that the most important thing of it is that we stopped listening to patients. [SEP] officer things radboud university appointed chief listening [SEP]
[CLS] patients important thing stopped listening [SEP] and one of the things we did at radboud university is we appointed a chief listening officer. [SEP] family relatives cup patients scientific puts coffee tea [SEP]
[CLS] officer things radboud university appointed chief listening [SEP] not in a very scientific way -- she puts up a little cup of coffee or cup of tea and asks patients, family, relatives, "what's up? [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] family relatives cup patients scientific puts coffee tea [SEP] how could we help you? " [SEP] fail listening major problems e-health projects stopped [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] and we think, we like to think, that this is one of the major problems why all -- maybe not all -- but most of the e-health projects fail, since we stopped listening. [SEP] scale wifi thing simple [SEP]
[CLS] fail listening major problems e-health projects stopped [SEP] this is my wifi scale. it's a very simple thing. [SEP] knob [SEP]

[CLS] challenge [SEP] and i put my challenge on 95 kg. [SEP] thing made simple hop sends data google health [SEP]
[CLS] put challenge [SEP] but the thing is that it's made this simple that whenever i hop on, it sends my data through google health as well. [SEP] weight backward collected general practitioner problem moment cardiologic support [SEP]
[CLS] thing made simple hop sends data google health [SEP] and it's collected by my general practitioner as well, so he can see what's my problem in weight, not on the very moment that i need cardiologic support or something like it, but also looking backward. [SEP] thing [SEP]
[CLS] weight backward collected general practitioner problem moment cardiologic support [SEP] but there's another thing. [SEP] followers twitter [SEP]

[CLS] followers twitter [SEP] so every morning i hop on my wifi scale and before i'm in my car, people start talking to me, "i think you need a light lunch today, lucien." [SEP] patients peer pressure happen obesity nicest thing stop smoking [SEP]
[CLS] lucien car people today morning hop wifi scale start talking [SEP] but that's the nicest thing that could happen, since this is peer pressure, peer pressure used to help patients -- since this could be used for obesity, it could be used to stop smoking in patients. [SEP] hand health people chairs work kind gaming activity control [SEP]

[CLS]  [SEP] so a couple of years ago i started a program to try to get the rockstar tech and design people to take a year off and work in the one environment that represents pretty much everything they're supposed to hate; we have them work in government. [SEP] america geeks program called code bit peace corps [SEP]
[CLS] work hate government couple ago started program rockstar tech design [SEP] the program is called code for america, and it's a little bit like a peace corps for geeks. [SEP] governments select fellows year work city [SEP]
[CLS] america geeks program called code bit peace corps [SEP] we select a few fellows every year and we have them work with city governments. [SEP] world hall sending send wilds city [SEP]
[CLS] governments select fellows year work city [SEP] instead of sending them off into the third world, we send them into the wilds of city hall. [SEP] apps staffers make great work city [SEP]
[CLS] world hall sending send wilds city [SEP] and there they make great apps, they work with city staffers. [SEP] today showing technology [SEP]
[CLS] apps staffers make great work city [SEP] but really what they're doing is they're showing what's possible with technology today. [SEP] meet [SEP]
[CLS] today showing technology [SEP] so meet al. [SEP] boston fire hydrant city [SEP]
[CLS] meet [SEP] al is a fire hydrant in the city of boston. [SEP] date snow kind shovel snowed good fighting fires covered feet [SEP]
[CLS] boston fire hydrant city [SEP] here it kind of looks like he's looking for a date, but what he's really looking for is for someone to shovel him out when he gets snowed in, because he knows he's not very good at fighting fires when he's covered in four feet of snow. [SEP] manner unique [SEP]
[CLS] date snow kind shovel snowed good fighting fires covered feet [SEP] now how did he come to be looking for help in this very unique manner? [SEP] program team fellows boston year code america [SEP]
[CLS] manner unique [SEP] we had a team of fellows in boston last year through the code for america program. [SEP] february year snowed lot [SEP]
[CLS] program team fellows boston year code america [SEP] they were there in february, and it snowed a lot in february last year. [SEP] hydrants noticed city digging fire [SEP]
[CLS] february year snowed lot [SEP] and they noticed that the city never gets to digging out these fire hydrants. [SEP] michaels-ober noticed things fellow guy named erik citizens shoveling sidewalks [SEP]
[CLS] hydrants noticed city digging fire [SEP] but one fellow in particular, a guy named erik michaels-ober, noticed something else, and that's that citizens are shoveling out sidewalks right in front of these things. [SEP] app good developer wrote [SEP]
[CLS] michaels-ober noticed things fellow guy named erik citizens shoveling sidewalks [SEP] so he did what any good developer would do, he wrote an app. [SEP] hydrant cute app adopt fire [SEP]
[CLS] app good developer wrote [SEP] it's a cute little app where you can adopt a fire hydrant. [SEP] snows agree dig [SEP]
[CLS] hydrant cute app adopt fire [SEP] so you agree to dig it out when it snows. [SEP] called [SEP]
[CLS] snows agree dig [SEP] if you do, you get to name it, and he called the first one al. [SEP] steal [SEP]
[CLS] called [SEP] and if you don't, someone can steal it from you. [SEP] cute game dynamics [SEP]
[CLS] steal [SEP] so it's got cute little game dynamics on it. [SEP] app modest [SEP]
[CLS] cute game dynamics [SEP] this is a modest little app. [SEP] apps year smallest fellows wrote [SEP]
[CLS] app modest [SEP] it's probably the smallest of the 21 apps that the fellows wrote last year. [SEP] government technology [SEP]
[CLS] apps year smallest fellows wrote [SEP] but it's doing something that no other government technology does. [SEP] virally spreading [SEP]
[CLS] government technology [SEP] it's spreading virally. [SEP] department snow sirens guy city honolulu app realized citizens adopt [SEP]
[CLS] virally spreading [SEP] there's a guy in the i.t. department of the city of honolulu who saw this app and realized that he could use it, not for snow, but to get citizens to adopt tsunami sirens. [SEP] work important tsunami sirens people steal batteries [SEP]
[CLS] department snow sirens guy city honolulu app realized citizens adopt [SEP] it's very important that these tsunami sirens work, but people steal the batteries out of them. [SEP] citizens check [SEP]
[CLS] work important tsunami sirens people steal batteries [SEP] so he's getting citizens to check on them. [SEP] drains seattle decided citizens clear clogged storm [SEP]
[CLS] citizens check [SEP] and then seattle decided to use it to get citizens to clear out clogged storm drains. [SEP] snows chicago rolled people sign shovel sidewalks [SEP]
[CLS] drains seattle decided citizens clear clogged storm [SEP] and chicago just rolled it out to get people to sign up to shovel sidewalks when it snows. [SEP] cities planning [SEP]
[CLS] snows chicago rolled people sign shovel sidewalks [SEP] so we now know of nine cities that are planning to use this. [SEP] organically naturally frictionlessly spread [SEP]
[CLS] cities planning [SEP] and this has spread just frictionlessly, organically, naturally. [SEP] technology government [SEP]
[CLS] organically naturally frictionlessly spread [SEP] if you know anything about government technology, you know that this isn't how it normally goes. [SEP] procuring years software couple [SEP]
[CLS] technology government [SEP] procuring software usually takes a couple of years. [SEP] months team worked project boston year people half [SEP]
[CLS] procuring years software couple [SEP] we had a team that worked on a project in boston last year that took three people about two and a half months. [SEP] kids parents figure public schools [SEP]
[CLS] months team worked project boston year people half [SEP] it was a way that parents could figure out which were the right public schools for their kids. [SEP] channels dollars told afterward normal years cost million [SEP]
[CLS] kids parents figure public schools [SEP] we were told afterward that if that had gone through normal channels, it would have taken at least two years and it would have cost about two million dollars. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] channels dollars told afterward normal years cost million [SEP] and that's nothing. [SEP] dollars work project california court system cost taxpayers billion [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] there is one project in the california court system right now that so far cost taxpayers two billion dollars, and it doesn't work. [SEP] government projects level [SEP]
[CLS] dollars work project california court system cost taxpayers billion [SEP] and there are projects like this at every level of government. [SEP] virally government app couple days write spreads sort shot bow [SEP]
[CLS] government projects level [SEP] so an app that takes a couple of days to write and then spreads virally, that's sort of a shot across the bow to the institution of government. [SEP] company suggests government work private people [SEP]
[CLS] virally government app couple days write spreads sort shot bow [SEP] it suggests how government could work better -- not more like a private company, as many people think it should. [SEP] company tech internet [SEP]
[CLS] company suggests government work private people [SEP] and not even like a tech company, but more like the internet itself. [SEP] permissionless open generative [SEP]
[CLS] company tech internet [SEP] and that means permissionless, it means open, it means generative. [SEP] important [SEP]
[CLS] permissionless open generative [SEP] and that's important. [SEP] problem government institution action important app represents generation tackling ossified [SEP]
[CLS] important [SEP] but what's more important about this app is that it represents how a new generation is tackling the problem of government -- not as the problem of an ossified institution, but as a problem of collective action. [SEP] technology great turns good collective action digital [SEP]
[CLS] problem government institution action important app represents generation tackling ossified [SEP] and that's great news, because, it turns out, we're very good at collective action with digital technology. [SEP] effectively large community people building tools things [SEP]
[CLS] technology great turns good collective action digital [SEP] now there's a very large community of people that are building the tools that we need to do things together effectively. [SEP] fellows communities code america hundreds people country standing writing civic [SEP]
[CLS] effectively large community people building tools things [SEP] it's not just code for america fellows, there are hundreds of people all over the country that are standing and writing civic apps every day in their own communities. [SEP] government [SEP]
[CLS] fellows communities code america hundreds people country standing writing civic [SEP] they haven't given up on government. [SEP] frustrated hell complaining fixing [SEP]
[CLS] government [SEP] they are frustrated as hell with it, but they're not complaining about it, they're fixing it. [SEP] folks lost sight [SEP]
[CLS] frustrated hell complaining fixing [SEP] and these folks know something that we've lost sight of. [SEP] government core o'reilly strip feelings politics line dmv things mad [SEP]
[CLS] folks lost sight [SEP] and that's that when you strip away all your feelings about politics and the line at the dmv and all those other things that we're really mad about, government is, at its core, in the words of tim o'reilly, "what we do together that we can't do alone." [SEP] government lot people [SEP]
[CLS] government core o'reilly strip feelings politics line dmv things mad [SEP] now a lot of people have given up on government. [SEP] people reconsider changing things [SEP]
[CLS] government lot people [SEP] and if you're one of those people, i would ask that you reconsider, because things are changing. [SEP] changing politics government [SEP]
[CLS] people reconsider changing things [SEP] politics is not changing; government is changing. [SEP] remember people government ultimately derives power effect change [SEP]
[CLS] changing politics government [SEP] and because government ultimately derives its power from us -- remember "we the people?" -- how we think about it is going to effect how that change happens. [SEP] program government started [SEP]
[CLS] remember people government ultimately derives power effect change [SEP] now i didn't know very much about government when i started this program. [SEP] office people lot thought government basically elected [SEP]
[CLS] program government started [SEP] and like a lot of people, i thought government was basically about getting people elected to office. [SEP] years government opossums conclusion local [SEP]
[CLS] office people lot thought government basically elected [SEP] well after two years, i've come to the conclusion that, especially local government, is about opossums. [SEP] line call center services information [SEP]
[CLS] years government opossums conclusion local [SEP] this is the call center for the services and information line. [SEP] call city generally [SEP]
[CLS] line call center services information [SEP] it's generally where you will get if you call 311 in your city. [SEP] center program fact issues including house call chance staff city [SEP]
[CLS] call city generally [SEP] if you should ever have the chance to staff your city's call center, as our fellow scott silverman did as part of the program -- in fact, they all do that -- you will find that people call government with a very wide range of issues, including having an opossum stuck in your house. [SEP] call scott [SEP]
[CLS] center program fact issues including house call chance staff city [SEP] so scott gets this call. [SEP] opossum types base official knowledge [SEP]
[CLS] call scott [SEP] he types "opossum" into this official knowledge base. [SEP] control starts animal [SEP]
[CLS] opossum types base official knowledge [SEP] he doesn't really come up with anything. he starts with animal control. [SEP] finally leaves open doors house play music loud thing [SEP]
[CLS] control starts animal [SEP] and finally, he says, "look, can you just open all the doors to your house and play music really loud and see if the thing leaves?" [SEP] worked scott booya [SEP]
[CLS] finally leaves open doors house play music loud thing [SEP] so that worked. so booya for scott. [SEP] opossums end [SEP]
[CLS] worked scott booya [SEP] but that wasn't the end of the opossums. [SEP] boston center call [SEP]
[CLS] opossums end [SEP] boston doesn't just have a call center. [SEP] app called connect web mobile citizens [SEP]
[CLS] boston center call [SEP] it has an app, a web and mobile app, called citizens connect. [SEP] app write [SEP]
[CLS] app called connect web mobile citizens [SEP] now we didn't write this app. [SEP] boston work smart people office urban mechanics [SEP]
[CLS] app write [SEP] this is the work of the very smart people at the office of new urban mechanics in boston. [SEP] day report opossum trashcan actual dead [SEP]
[CLS] boston work smart people office urban mechanics [SEP] so one day -- this is an actual report -- this came in: "opossum in my trashcan. can't tell if it's dead. [SEP] removed [SEP]
[CLS] day report opossum trashcan actual dead [SEP] how do i get this removed? " [SEP] citizens connect [SEP]
[CLS] removed [SEP] but what happens with citizens connect is different. [SEP] speaking scott [SEP]
[CLS] citizens connect [SEP] so scott was speaking person-to-person. [SEP] public citizens connect [SEP]
[CLS] speaking scott [SEP] but on citizens connect everything is public, so everybody can see this. [SEP] case neighbor [SEP]
[CLS] public citizens connect [SEP] and in this case, a neighbor saw it. [SEP] location found house report walked trashcan [SEP]
[CLS] case neighbor [SEP] and the next report we got said, "i walked over to this location, found the trashcan behind the house. [SEP] opossum yep check. living [SEP]
[CLS] location found house report walked trashcan [SEP] opossum? check. living? yep. [SEP] turned side trashcan walked home [SEP]
[CLS] opossum yep check. living [SEP] turned trashcan on its side. walked home. [SEP] goodnight opossum sweet [SEP]
[CLS] turned side trashcan walked home [SEP] goodnight sweet opossum. " [SEP] pretty simple [SEP]
[CLS] goodnight opossum sweet [SEP] pretty simple. [SEP] great physical digital meeting [SEP]
[CLS] pretty simple [SEP] so this is great. this is the digital meeting the physical. [SEP] game great government crowd-sourcing [SEP]
[CLS] great physical digital meeting [SEP] and it's also a great example of government getting in on the crowd-sourcing game. [SEP] platform great government [SEP]
[CLS] game great government crowd-sourcing [SEP] but it's also a great example of government as a platform. [SEP] necessarily technological definition platform [SEP]
[CLS] platform great government [SEP] and i don't mean necessarily a technological definition of platform here. [SEP] talking platform people [SEP]
[CLS] necessarily technological definition platform [SEP] i'm just talking about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others. [SEP] citizen helped government played key role [SEP]
[CLS] talking platform people [SEP] so one citizen helped another citizen, but government played a key role here. [SEP] people connected [SEP]
[CLS] citizen helped government played key role [SEP] it connected those two people. [SEP] government services needed connected neighbor cheaper alternative [SEP]
[CLS] people connected [SEP] and it could have connected them with government services if they'd been needed, but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative to government services. [SEP] communities neighbor strengthen [SEP]
[CLS] government services needed connected neighbor cheaper alternative [SEP] when one neighbor helps another, we strengthen our communities. [SEP] control money call animal costs lot [SEP]
[CLS] communities neighbor strengthen [SEP] we call animal control, it just costs a lot of money. [SEP] politics important government things thing [SEP]
[CLS] control money call animal costs lot [SEP] now one of the important things we need to think about government is that it's not the same thing as politics. [SEP] people input [SEP]
[CLS] politics important government things thing [SEP] and most people get that, but they think that one is the input to the other. [SEP] voting input system government [SEP]
[CLS] people input [SEP] that our input to the system of government is voting. [SEP] political leader elected times spend lot energy sit back expect [SEP]
[CLS] voting input system government [SEP] now how many times have we elected a political leader -- and sometimes we spend a lot of energy getting a new political leader elected -- and then we sit back and we expect government to reflect our values and meet our needs, and then not that much changes? [SEP] top government vast ocean politics six-inch layer [SEP]
[CLS] political leader elected times spend lot energy sit back expect [SEP] that's because government is like a vast ocean and politics is the six-inch layer on top. [SEP] bureaucracy call [SEP]
[CLS] top government vast ocean politics six-inch layer [SEP] and what's under that is what we call bureaucracy. [SEP] contempt word [SEP]
[CLS] bureaucracy call [SEP] and we say that word with such contempt. [SEP] thing contempt pay working disempowering [SEP]
[CLS] contempt word [SEP] but it's that contempt that keeps this thing that we own and we pay for as something that's working against us, this other thing, and then we're disempowering ourselves. [SEP] people sexy politics [SEP]
[CLS] thing contempt pay working disempowering [SEP] people seem to think politics is sexy. [SEP] sexy institution work make bureaucracy [SEP]
[CLS] people sexy politics [SEP] if we want this institution to work for us, we're going to have to make bureaucracy sexy. [SEP] real work government [SEP]
[CLS] sexy institution work make bureaucracy [SEP] because that's where the real work of government happens. [SEP] government engage machinery [SEP]
[CLS] real work government [SEP] we have to engage with the machinery of government. [SEP] occupythesec movement [SEP]
[CLS] government engage machinery [SEP] so that's occupythesec movement has done. [SEP] guys [SEP]
[CLS] occupythesec movement [SEP] have you seen these guys? [SEP] detailed report bill group concerned citizens written response sec request [SEP]
[CLS] guys [SEP] it's a group of concerned citizens that have written a very detailed 325-page report that's a response to the sec's request for comment on the financial reform bill. [SEP] active politically bureaucratically [SEP]
[CLS] detailed report bill group concerned citizens written response sec request [SEP] that's not being politically active, that's being bureaucratically active. [SEP] government children time asked world leave [SEP]
[CLS] active politically bureaucratically [SEP] now for those of us who've given up on government, it's time that we asked ourselves about the world that we want to leave for our children. [SEP] face enormous challenges [SEP]
[CLS] government children time asked world leave [SEP] you have to see the enormous challenges that they're going to face. [SEP] fixing institution act behalf [SEP]
[CLS] face enormous challenges [SEP] do we really think we're going to get where we need to go without fixing the one institution that can act on behalf of all of us? [SEP] government effective [SEP]
[CLS] fixing institution act behalf [SEP] we can't do without government, but we do need it to be more effective. [SEP] society good technology making fundamentally reframe function government scale strengthening [SEP]
[CLS] government effective [SEP] the good news is that technology is making it possible to fundamentally reframe the function of government in a way that can actually scale by strengthening civil society. [SEP] internet generation grown hard things architect systems [SEP]
[CLS] society good technology making fundamentally reframe function government scale strengthening [SEP] and there's a generation out there that's grown up on the internet, and they know that it's not that hard to do things together, you just have to architect the systems the right way. [SEP] begrudgingly average age fellows generation older [SEP]
[CLS] internet generation grown hard things architect systems [SEP] now the average age of our fellows is 28, so i am, begrudgingly, almost a generation older than most of them. [SEP] granted generation grown taking voices pretty [SEP]
[CLS] begrudgingly average age fellows generation older [SEP] this is a generation that's grown up taking their voices pretty much for granted. [SEP] speak fighting battle [SEP]
[CLS] granted generation grown taking voices pretty [SEP] they're not fighting that battle that we're all fighting about who gets to speak; they all get to speak. [SEP] time express opinion channel [SEP]
[CLS] speak fighting battle [SEP] they can express their opinion on any channel at any time, and they do. [SEP] government voices faced problem care [SEP]
[CLS] time express opinion channel [SEP] so when they're faced with the problem of government, they don't care as much about using their voices. [SEP] hands [SEP]
[CLS] government voices faced problem care [SEP] they're using their hands. [SEP] hands write applications make government work [SEP]
[CLS] hands [SEP] they're using their hands to write applications that make government work better. [SEP] applications hands make communities [SEP]
[CLS] hands write applications make government work [SEP] and those applications let us use our hands to make our communities better. [SEP] hydrant pulling weed turning shoveling garbage opossum [SEP]
[CLS] applications hands make communities [SEP] that could be shoveling out a hydrant, pulling a weed, turning over a garbage can with an opossum in it. [SEP] shoveling fire hydrants people [SEP]
[CLS] hydrant pulling weed turning shoveling garbage opossum [SEP] and certainly, we could have been shoveling out those fire hydrants all along, and many people do. [SEP] consumers government putting services apps digital reminders taxes back [SEP]
[CLS] shoveling fire hydrants people [SEP] but these apps are like little digital reminders that we're not just consumers, and we're not just consumers of government, putting in our taxes and getting back services. [SEP] citizens [SEP]
[CLS] consumers government putting services apps digital reminders taxes back [SEP] we're more than that, we're citizens. [SEP] citizenship fix government [SEP]
[CLS] citizens [SEP] and we're not going to fix government until we fix citizenship. [SEP] crowd big important voices hands question things [SEP]
[CLS] citizenship fix government [SEP] so the question i have for all of you here: when it comes to the big, important things that we need to do together, all of us together, are we just going to be a crowd of voices, or are we also going to be a crowd of hands? [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] crowd big important voices hands question things [SEP] thank you. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] because i usually take the role of trying to explain to people how wonderful the new technologies that are coming along are going to be, and i thought that, since i was among friends here, i would tell you what i really think and try to look back and try to understand what is really going on here with these amazing jumps in technology that seem so fast that we can barely keep on top of it. [SEP] slide start showing boring technology [SEP]
[CLS] role explain people wonderful technologies coming thought friends back understand [SEP] so i'm going to start out by showing just one very boring technology slide. [SEP] turn slide [SEP]
[CLS] slide start showing boring technology [SEP] and then, so if you can just turn on the slide that's on. [SEP] file random slide picked [SEP]
[CLS] turn slide [SEP] this is just a random slide that i picked out of my file. [SEP] slide show details general form [SEP]
[CLS] file random slide picked [SEP] what i want to show you is not so much the details of the slide, but the general form of it. [SEP] power networks slide analysis risc microprocessors versus local area [SEP]
[CLS] slide show details general form [SEP] this happens to be a slide of some analysis that we were doing about the power of risc microprocessors versus the power of local area networks. [SEP] curve interesting thing technology sort straight line semi-log slide slides [SEP]
[CLS] power networks slide analysis risc microprocessors versus local area [SEP] and the interesting thing about it is that this slide, like so many technology slides that we're used to, is a sort of a straight line on a semi-log curve. [SEP] words scale step represents order magnitude performance [SEP]
[CLS] curve interesting thing technology sort straight line semi-log slide slides [SEP] in other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude in performance scale. [SEP] curves thing talk technology semi-log [SEP]
[CLS] words scale step represents order magnitude performance [SEP] and this is a new thing that we talk about technology on semi-log curves. [SEP] weird [SEP]
[CLS] curves thing talk technology semi-log [SEP] something really weird is going on here. [SEP] basically talking [SEP]
[CLS] weird [SEP] and that's basically what i'm going to be talking about. [SEP] lights bring [SEP]
[CLS] basically talking [SEP] so, if you could bring up the lights. [SEP] higher bring lights piece paper [SEP]
[CLS] lights bring [SEP] if you could bring up the lights higher, because i'm just going to use a piece of paper here. [SEP] curves draw technology semi-log [SEP]
[CLS] higher bring lights piece paper [SEP] now why do we draw technology curves in semi-log curves? [SEP] sort years silly answer drew normal curve time measure technology [SEP]
[CLS] curves draw technology semi-log [SEP] well the answer is, if i drew it on a normal curve where, let's say, this is years, this is time of some sort, and this is whatever measure of the technology that i'm trying to graph, the graphs look sort of silly. [SEP] sort [SEP]
[CLS] sort years silly answer drew normal curve time measure technology [SEP] they sort of go like this. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] sort [SEP] and they don't tell us much. [SEP] technology graph instance curve stupid line transportation semi-log flat [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] now if i graph, for instance, some other technology, say transportation technology, on a semi-log curve, it would look very stupid, it would look like a flat line. [SEP] things changing qualitatively [SEP]
[CLS] technology graph instance curve stupid line transportation semi-log flat [SEP] but when something like this happens, things are qualitatively changing. [SEP] technology tomorrow transportation moving fast microprocessor day taxi cab tokyo [SEP]
[CLS] things changing qualitatively [SEP] so if transportation technology was moving along as fast as microprocessor technology, then the day after tomorrow, i would be able to get in a taxi cab and be in tokyo in 30 seconds. [SEP] moving [SEP]
[CLS] technology tomorrow transportation moving fast microprocessor day taxi cab tokyo [SEP] it's not moving like that. [SEP] years precedented history technology development kind self-feeding growth orders magnitude [SEP]
[CLS] moving [SEP] and there's nothing precedented in the history of technology development of this kind of self-feeding growth where you go by orders of magnitude every few years. [SEP] curves forever question exponential [SEP]
[CLS] years precedented history technology development kind self-feeding growth orders magnitude [SEP] now the question that i'd like to ask is, if you look at these exponential curves, they don't go on forever. [SEP] things possibly changing fast [SEP]
[CLS] curves forever question exponential [SEP] things just can't possibly keep changing as fast as they are. [SEP] happen things [SEP]
[CLS] things possibly changing fast [SEP] one of two things is going to happen. [SEP] turn sort classical s-curve totally [SEP]
[CLS] happen things [SEP] either it's going to turn into a sort of classical s-curve like this, until something totally different comes along, or maybe it's going to do this. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] turn sort classical s-curve totally [SEP] that's about all it can do. [SEP] optimist sort [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] now i'm an optimist, so i sort of think it's probably going to do something like that. [SEP] transition middle [SEP]
[CLS] optimist sort [SEP] if so, that means that what we're in the middle of right now is a transition. [SEP] world sort line transition [SEP]
[CLS] transition middle [SEP] we're sort of on this line in a transition from the way the world used to be to some new way that the world is. [SEP] world [SEP]
[CLS] world sort line transition [SEP] and so what i'm trying to ask, what i've been asking myself, is what's this new way that the world is? [SEP] state world heading [SEP]
[CLS] world [SEP] what's that new state that the world is heading toward? [SEP] transition confusing middle [SEP]
[CLS] state world heading [SEP] because the transition seems very, very confusing when we're right in the middle of it. [SEP] year kid growing future kind people talk happen [SEP]
[CLS] transition confusing middle [SEP] now when i was a kid growing up, the future was kind of the year 2000, and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000. [SEP] future year conference people talk notice [SEP]
[CLS] year kid growing future kind people talk happen [SEP] now here's a conference in which people talk about the future, and you notice that the future is still at about the year 2000. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] future year conference people talk notice [SEP] it's about as far as we go out. [SEP] words lifetime year future kind shrinking [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] so in other words, the future has kind of been shrinking one year per year for my whole lifetime. [SEP] reason feel happening [SEP]
[CLS] words lifetime year future kind shrinking [SEP] now i think that the reason is because we all feel that something's happening there. [SEP] happening transition sense [SEP]
[CLS] reason feel happening [SEP] that transition is happening. we can all sense it. [SEP] make years sense simple extrapolation [SEP]
[CLS] happening transition sense [SEP] and we know that it just doesn't make too much sense to think out 30, 50 years because everything's going to be so different that a simple extrapolation of what we're doing just doesn't make any sense at all. [SEP] talk transition [SEP]
[CLS] make years sense simple extrapolation [SEP] so what i would like to talk about is what that could be, what that transition could be that we're going through. [SEP] computers order talk bunch stuff technology [SEP]
[CLS] talk transition [SEP] now in order to do that i'm going to have to talk about a bunch of stuff that really has nothing to do with technology and computers. [SEP] things understand step back long time scale [SEP]
[CLS] computers order talk bunch stuff technology [SEP] because i think the only way to understand this is to really step back and take a long time scale look at things. [SEP] time scale earth life [SEP]
[CLS] things understand step back long time scale [SEP] so the time scale that i would like to look at this on is the time scale of life on earth. [SEP] time picture makes sense billion years [SEP]
[CLS] time scale earth life [SEP] so i think this picture makes sense if you look at it a few billion years at a time. [SEP] years big sterile back half billion earth hunk rock lot [SEP]
[CLS] time picture makes sense billion years [SEP] so if you go back about two and a half billion years, the earth was this big, sterile hunk of rock with a lot of chemicals floating around on it. [SEP] organized chemicals begin pretty good idea [SEP]
[CLS] years big sterile back half billion earth hunk rock lot [SEP] and if you look at the way that the chemicals got organized, we begin to get a pretty good idea of how they do it. [SEP] rna time theories beginning understand started sort simple story drops [SEP]
[CLS] organized chemicals begin pretty good idea [SEP] and i think that there's theories that are beginning to understand about how it started with rna, but i'm going to tell a sort of simple story of it, which is that, at that time, there were little drops of oil floating around with all kinds of different recipes of chemicals in them. [SEP] drops oil chemicals combination caused incorporate grow [SEP]
[CLS] rna time theories beginning understand started sort simple story drops [SEP] and some of those drops of oil had a particular combination of chemicals in them which caused them to incorporate chemicals from the outside and grow the drops of oil. [SEP] divide started split [SEP]
[CLS] drops oil chemicals combination caused incorporate grow [SEP] and those that were like that started to split and divide. [SEP] sense oil primitive forms cells drops [SEP]
[CLS] divide started split [SEP] and those were the most primitive forms of cells in a sense, those little drops of oil. [SEP] alive chemicals drops oil random recipe [SEP]
[CLS] sense oil primitive forms cells drops [SEP] but now those drops of oil weren't really alive, as we say it now, because every one of them was a little random recipe of chemicals. [SEP] divided time sort unequal division chemicals [SEP]
[CLS] alive chemicals drops oil random recipe [SEP] and every time it divided, they got sort of unequal division of the chemicals within them. [SEP] drop bit [SEP]
[CLS] divided time sort unequal division chemicals [SEP] and so every drop was a little bit different. [SEP] chemicals fact grew drops caused incorporating incorporated divided [SEP]
[CLS] drop bit [SEP] in fact, the drops that were different in a way that caused them to be better at incorporating chemicals around them, grew more and incorporated more chemicals and divided more. [SEP] longer tended live expressed [SEP]
[CLS] chemicals fact grew drops caused incorporating incorporated divided [SEP] so those tended to live longer, get expressed more. [SEP] life abstraction sort simple chemical form things interesting drops learned [SEP]
[CLS] longer tended live expressed [SEP] now that's sort of just a very simple chemical form of life, but when things got interesting was when these drops learned a trick about abstraction. [SEP] understand information drops learned write [SEP]
[CLS] life abstraction sort simple chemical form things interesting drops learned [SEP] somehow by ways that we don't quite understand, these little drops learned to write down information. [SEP] dna learned record information recipe cell kind chemical called [SEP]
[CLS] understand information drops learned write [SEP] they learned to record the information that was the recipe of the cell onto a particular kind of chemical called dna. [SEP] writing words copied worked mindless sort evolutionary form write [SEP]
[CLS] dna learned record information recipe cell kind chemical called [SEP] so in other words, they worked out, in this mindless sort of evolutionary way, a form of writing that let them write down what they were, so that that way of writing it down could get copied. [SEP] ago amazing thing writing stayed steady evolved half billion years [SEP]
[CLS] writing words copied worked mindless sort evolutionary form write [SEP] the amazing thing is that that way of writing seems to have stayed steady since it evolved two and a half billion years ago. [SEP] genes writing fact recipe code [SEP]
[CLS] ago amazing thing writing stayed steady evolved half billion years [SEP] in fact the recipe for us, our genes, is exactly that same code and that same way of writing. [SEP] fact code living creature written set letters [SEP]
[CLS] genes writing fact recipe code [SEP] in fact, every living creature is written in exactly the same set of letters and the same code. [SEP] fact code things amusement purposes write [SEP]
[CLS] fact code living creature written set letters [SEP] in fact, one of the things that i did just for amusement purposes is we can now write things in this code. [SEP] micrograms powder airports white security people [SEP]
[CLS] fact code things amusement purposes write [SEP] and i've got here a little 100 micrograms of white powder, which i try not to let the security people see at airports. [SEP] times code standard letters symbolizing wrote business card piece dna [SEP]
[CLS] micrograms powder airports white security people [SEP] but this has in it -- what i did is i took this code -- the code has standard letters that we use for symbolizing it -- and i wrote my business card onto a piece of dna and amplified it 10 to the 22 times. [SEP] card room fact world hundred million copies business plenty [SEP]
[CLS] times code standard letters symbolizing wrote business card piece dna [SEP] so if anyone would like a hundred million copies of my business card, i have plenty for everyone in the room, and, in fact, everyone in the world, and it's right here. [SEP] egotist room put virus released [SEP]
[CLS] card room fact world hundred million copies business plenty [SEP] if i had really been a egotist, i would have put it into a virus and released it in the room. [SEP] step [SEP]
[CLS] egotist room put virus released [SEP] so what was the next step? [SEP] writing step dna interesting [SEP]
[CLS] step [SEP] writing down the dna was an interesting step. [SEP] cells years caused happy billion [SEP]
[CLS] writing step dna interesting [SEP] and that caused these cells -- that kept them happy for another billion years. [SEP] information cells interesting step things completely started exchanging communicating began [SEP]
[CLS] cells years caused happy billion [SEP] but then there was another really interesting step where things became completely different, which is these cells started exchanging and communicating information, so that they began to get communities of cells. [SEP] dna bacteria exchange [SEP]
[CLS] information cells interesting step things completely started exchanging communicating began [SEP] i don't know if you know this, but bacteria can actually exchange dna. [SEP] instance antibiotic evolved resistance [SEP]
[CLS] dna bacteria exchange [SEP] now that's why, for instance, antibiotic resistance has evolved. [SEP] penicillin bacteria communicate figured stay sort creating dna information lot [SEP]
[CLS] instance antibiotic evolved resistance [SEP] some bacteria figured out how to stay away from penicillin, and it went around sort of creating its little dna information with other bacteria, and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin, because bacteria communicate. [SEP] sense synergistic communication allowed communities form boat [SEP]
[CLS] penicillin bacteria communicate figured stay sort creating dna information lot [SEP] now what this communication allowed was communities to form that, in some sense, were in the same boat together; they were synergistic. [SEP] community successful evolution survived failed individuals repeated favored [SEP]
[CLS] sense synergistic communication allowed communities form boat [SEP] so they survived or they failed together, which means that if a community was very successful, all the individuals in that community were repeated more and they were favored by evolution. [SEP] fact dna transition point happened communities close decided write recipe [SEP]
[CLS] community successful evolution survived failed individuals repeated favored [SEP] now the transition point happened when these communities got so close that, in fact, they got together and decided to write down the whole recipe for the community together on one string of dna. [SEP] years stage interesting life billion [SEP]
[CLS] fact dna transition point happened communities close decided write recipe [SEP] and so the next stage that's interesting in life took about another billion years. [SEP] communities stage cells working organism multi-cellular lots types single [SEP]
[CLS] years stage interesting life billion [SEP] and at that stage, we have multi-cellular communities, communities of lots of different types of cells, working together as a single organism. [SEP] fact community multi-cellular [SEP]
[CLS] communities stage cells working organism multi-cellular lots types single [SEP] and in fact, we're such a multi-cellular community. [SEP] anymore lots cells [SEP]
[CLS] fact community multi-cellular [SEP] we have lots of cells that are not out for themselves anymore. [SEP] cell muscle skin useless heart brain [SEP]
[CLS] anymore lots cells [SEP] your skin cell is really useless without a heart cell, muscle cell, a brain cell and so on. [SEP] cell organism communities began evolve interesting level evolution taking place [SEP]
[CLS] cell muscle skin useless heart brain [SEP] so these communities began to evolve so that the interesting level on which evolution was taking place was no longer a cell, but a community which we call an organism. [SEP] communities step happened [SEP]
[CLS] cell organism communities began evolve interesting level evolution taking place [SEP] now the next step that happened is within these communities. [SEP] cells began information communities abstract [SEP]
[CLS] communities step happened [SEP] these communities of cells, again, began to abstract information. [SEP] community began building special structures process information [SEP]
[CLS] cells began information communities abstract [SEP] and they began building very special structures that did nothing but process information within the community. [SEP] structures neural [SEP]
[CLS] community began building special structures process information [SEP] and those are the neural structures. [SEP] neurons information processing apparatus communities cells built [SEP]
[CLS] structures neural [SEP] so neurons are the information processing apparatus that those communities of cells built up. [SEP] understanding fact recording learning information began specialists community special structures [SEP]
[CLS] neurons information processing apparatus communities cells built [SEP] and in fact, they began to get specialists in the community and special structures that were responsible for recording, understanding, learning information. [SEP] communities brains nervous system [SEP]
[CLS] understanding fact recording learning information began specialists community special structures [SEP] and that was the brains and the nervous system of those communities. [SEP] advantage gave evolutionary [SEP]
[CLS] communities brains nervous system [SEP] and that gave them an evolutionary advantage. [SEP] time span point individual learning organism happen single evolutionary [SEP]
[CLS] advantage gave evolutionary [SEP] because at that point, an individual -- learning could happen within the time span of a single organism, instead of over this evolutionary time span. [SEP] instance learn organism eat kind fruit tasted bad sick time [SEP]
[CLS] time span point individual learning organism happen single evolutionary [SEP] so an organism could, for instance, learn not to eat a certain kind of fruit because it tasted bad and it got sick last time it ate it. [SEP] organism structures fruit happen lifetime single built special information processing [SEP]
[CLS] instance learn organism eat kind fruit tasted bad sick time [SEP] that could happen within the lifetime of a single organism, whereas before they'd built these special information processing structures, that would have had to be learned evolutionarily over hundreds of thousands of years by the individuals dying off that ate that kind of fruit. [SEP] system structures individual nervous fact built special information evolution happen [SEP]
[CLS] organism structures fruit happen lifetime single built special information processing [SEP] so that nervous system, the fact that they built these special information structures, because evolution could now happen within an individual. [SEP] scales happen learning time [SEP]
[CLS] system structures individual nervous fact built special information evolution happen [SEP] it could happen in learning time scales. [SEP] tricks communicating happened individuals worked [SEP]
[CLS] scales happen learning time [SEP] but then what happened was the individuals worked out, of course, tricks of communicating. [SEP] language sophisticated version aware human [SEP]
[CLS] tricks communicating happened individuals worked [SEP] and for example, the most sophisticated version that we're aware of is human language. [SEP] pretty amazing invention [SEP]
[CLS] language sophisticated version aware human [SEP] it's really a pretty amazing invention if you think about it. [SEP] messy complicated confused head idea [SEP]
[CLS] pretty amazing invention [SEP] here i have a very complicated, messy, confused idea in my head. [SEP] basically messy confused sitting making grunting sounds constructing similar idea [SEP]
[CLS] messy complicated confused head idea [SEP] i'm sitting here making grunting sounds basically, and hopefully constructing a similar messy, confused idea in your head that bears some analogy to it. [SEP] complicated turning sequences brain sound sounds taking producing [SEP]
[CLS] basically messy confused sitting making grunting sounds constructing similar idea [SEP] but we're taking something very complicated, turning it into sound, sequences of sounds, and producing something very complicated in your brain. [SEP] organism begin start functioning single [SEP]
[CLS] complicated turning sequences brain sound sounds taking producing [SEP] so this allows us now to begin to start functioning as a single organism. [SEP] humanity fact started abstracting [SEP]
[CLS] organism begin start functioning single [SEP] and so, in fact, what we've done is we, humanity, have started abstracting out. [SEP] presenting abstracting recording processing information levels multi-cellular organisms methods [SEP]
[CLS] humanity fact started abstracting [SEP] we're going through the same levels that multi-cellular organisms have gone through -- abstracting out our methods of recording, presenting, processing information. [SEP] direction invention language tiny step [SEP]
[CLS] presenting abstracting recording processing information levels multi-cellular organisms methods [SEP] so for example, the invention of language was a tiny step in that direction. [SEP] telephony computers videotapes cd-roms information specialized mechanisms built society handling [SEP]
[CLS] direction invention language tiny step [SEP] telephony, computers, videotapes, cd-roms and so on are all our specialized mechanisms that we've now built within our society for handling that information. [SEP] connects bigger faster evolve [SEP]
[CLS] telephony computers videotapes cd-roms information specialized mechanisms built society handling [SEP] and it all connects us together into something that is much bigger and much faster and able to evolve than what we were before. [SEP] evolution microseconds place scale [SEP]
[CLS] connects bigger faster evolve [SEP] so now, evolution can take place on a scale of microseconds. [SEP] eyes evolutionary sort bit evolution convolution program [SEP]
[CLS] evolution microseconds place scale [SEP] and you saw ty's little evolutionary example where he sort of did a little bit of evolution on the convolution program right before your eyes. [SEP] speeded time scales [SEP]
[CLS] eyes evolutionary sort bit evolution convolution program [SEP] so now we've speeded up the time scales once again. [SEP] piece steps story told billion years [SEP]
[CLS] speeded time scales [SEP] so the first steps of the story that i told you about took a billion years a piece. [SEP] steps brains years nervous systems hundred million [SEP]
[CLS] piece steps story told billion years [SEP] and the next steps, like nervous systems and brains, took a few hundred million years. [SEP] steps years language million [SEP]
[CLS] steps brains years nervous systems hundred million [SEP] then the next steps, like language and so on, took less than a million years. [SEP] steps electronics decades taking [SEP]
[CLS] steps years language million [SEP] and these next steps, like electronics, seem to be taking only a few decades. [SEP] guess autocatalytic change process feeding word reinforces rate [SEP]
[CLS] steps electronics decades taking [SEP] the process is feeding on itself and becoming, i guess, autocatalytic is the word for it -- when something reinforces its rate of change. [SEP] faster [SEP]
[CLS] guess autocatalytic change process feeding word reinforces rate [SEP] the more it changes, the faster it changes. [SEP] curve explosion [SEP]
[CLS] faster [SEP] and i think that that's what we're seeing here in this explosion of curve. [SEP] process feeding back [SEP]
[CLS] curve explosion [SEP] we're seeing this process feeding back on itself. [SEP] computers design living mechanisms impossible recent advances [SEP]
[CLS] process feeding back [SEP] now i design computers for a living, and i know that the mechanisms that i use to design computers would be impossible without recent advances in computers. [SEP] sense design objects complexity impossible traditional [SEP]
[CLS] computers design living mechanisms impossible recent advances [SEP] so right now, what i do is i design objects at such complexity that it's really impossible for me to design them in the traditional sense. [SEP] transistor connection machine [SEP]
[CLS] sense design objects complexity impossible traditional [SEP] i don't know what every transistor in the connection machine does. [SEP] billions [SEP]
[CLS] transistor connection machine [SEP] there are billions of them. [SEP] machine designers thinking level abstraction hand farther faster machines [SEP]
[CLS] billions [SEP] instead, what i do and what the designers at thinking machines do is we think at some level of abstraction and then we hand it to the machine and the machine takes it beyond what we could ever do, much farther and faster than we could ever do. [SEP] fact understand methods [SEP]
[CLS] machine designers thinking level abstraction hand farther faster machines [SEP] and in fact, sometimes it takes it by methods that we don't quite even understand. [SEP] method interesting lot evolution [SEP]
[CLS] fact understand methods [SEP] one method that's particularly interesting that i've been using a lot lately is evolution itself. [SEP] scale put inside machine process evolution place microsecond time [SEP]
[CLS] method interesting lot evolution [SEP] so what we do is we put inside the machine a process of evolution that takes place on the microsecond time scale. [SEP] cases instructions extreme evolve program starting random sequences [SEP]
[CLS] scale put inside machine process evolution place microsecond time [SEP] so for example, in the most extreme cases, we can actually evolve a program by starting out with random sequences of instructions. [SEP] computer instructions make hundred million random sequences [SEP]
[CLS] cases instructions extreme evolve program starting random sequences [SEP] say, "computer, would you please make a hundred million random sequences of instructions. [SEP] run instructions programs wanted random sequences pick closest [SEP]
[CLS] computer instructions make hundred million random sequences [SEP] now would you please run all of those random sequences of instructions, run all of those programs, and pick out the ones that came closest to doing what i wanted. " [SEP] words wanted define [SEP]
[CLS] run instructions programs wanted random sequences pick closest [SEP] so in other words, i define what i wanted. [SEP] numbers sort simple [SEP]
[CLS] words wanted define [SEP] let's say i want to sort numbers, as a simple example i've done it with. [SEP] numbers find programs closest sorting [SEP]
[CLS] numbers sort simple [SEP] so find the programs that come closest to sorting numbers. [SEP] random numbers sequences instructions sort [SEP]
[CLS] numbers find programs closest sorting [SEP] so of course, random sequences of instructions are very unlikely to sort numbers, so none of them will really do it. [SEP] luck order put numbers [SEP]
[CLS] random numbers sequences instructions sort [SEP] but one of them, by luck, may put two numbers in the right order. [SEP] computer percent job random sequences [SEP]
[CLS] luck order put numbers [SEP] and i say, "computer, would you please now take the 10 percent of those random sequences that did the best job. [SEP] save kill rest [SEP]
[CLS] computer percent job random sequences [SEP] save those. kill off the rest. [SEP] reproduce sorted numbers [SEP]
[CLS] save kill rest [SEP] and now let's reproduce the ones that sorted numbers the best. [SEP] sex reproduce process recombination analogous [SEP]
[CLS] reproduce sorted numbers [SEP] and let's reproduce them by a process of recombination analogous to sex. " [SEP] programs children subroutines produce exchanging inherit traits [SEP]
[CLS] sex reproduce process recombination analogous [SEP] take two programs and they produce children by exchanging their subroutines, and the children inherit the traits of the subroutines of the two programs. [SEP] programs job generation produced combinations bit [SEP]
[CLS] programs children subroutines produce exchanging inherit traits [SEP] so i've got now a new generation of programs that are produced by combinations of the programs that did a little bit better job. [SEP] process repeat [SEP]
[CLS] programs job generation produced combinations bit [SEP] say, "please repeat that process." [SEP] score [SEP]
[CLS] process repeat [SEP] score them again. [SEP] introduce mutations [SEP]
[CLS] score [SEP] introduce some mutations perhaps. [SEP] generation [SEP]
[CLS] introduce mutations [SEP] and try that again and do that for another generation. [SEP] milliseconds generations [SEP]
[CLS] generation [SEP] well every one of those generations just takes a few milliseconds. [SEP] minutes cases hours equivalent millions years evolution computer complicated [SEP]
[CLS] milliseconds generations [SEP] so i can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution on that within the computer in a few minutes, or in the complicated cases, in a few hours. [SEP] numbers end programs absolutely perfect sorting [SEP]
[CLS] minutes cases hours equivalent millions years evolution computer complicated [SEP] at the end of that, i end up with programs that are absolutely perfect at sorting numbers. [SEP] fact hand programs efficient written [SEP]
[CLS] numbers end programs absolutely perfect sorting [SEP] in fact, they are programs that are much more efficient than programs i could have ever written by hand. [SEP] programs work [SEP]
[CLS] fact hand programs efficient written [SEP] now if i look at those programs, i can't tell you how they work. [SEP] work telling [SEP]
[CLS] programs work [SEP] i've tried looking at them and telling you how they work. [SEP] obscure weird programs [SEP]
[CLS] work telling [SEP] they're obscure, weird programs. [SEP] job [SEP]
[CLS] obscure weird programs [SEP] but they do the job. [SEP] job fact confident line hundreds thousands programs [SEP]
[CLS] job [SEP] and in fact, i know, i'm very confident that they do the job because they come from a line of hundreds of thousands of programs that did the job. [SEP] fact job life depended [SEP]
[CLS] job fact confident line hundreds thousands programs [SEP] in fact, their life depended on doing the job. [SEP] riding marvin minsky pulls card [SEP]
[CLS] fact job life depended [SEP] i was riding in a 747 with marvin minsky once, and he pulls out this card and says, "oh look. look at this. [SEP] flight make plane hundreds thousands tiny parts working safe confident [SEP]
[CLS] riding marvin minsky pulls card [SEP] it says, 'this plane has hundreds of thousands of tiny parts working together to make you a safe flight.' doesn't that make you feel confident? " [SEP] fact complicated engineering process work [SEP]
[CLS] flight make plane hundreds thousands tiny parts working safe confident [SEP] in fact, we know that the engineering process doesn't work very well when it gets complicated. [SEP] engineering beginning depend computers process [SEP]
[CLS] fact complicated engineering process work [SEP] so we're beginning to depend on computers to do a process that's very different than engineering. [SEP] produce things complexity normal engineering [SEP]
[CLS] engineering beginning depend computers process [SEP] and it lets us produce things of much more complexity than normal engineering lets us produce. [SEP] understand options [SEP]
[CLS] produce things complexity normal engineering [SEP] and yet, we don't quite understand the options of it. [SEP] sense ahead [SEP]
[CLS] understand options [SEP] so in a sense, it's getting ahead of us. [SEP] faster programs make computers run process [SEP]
[CLS] sense ahead [SEP] we're now using those programs to make much faster computers so that we'll be able to run this process much faster. [SEP] feeding back [SEP]
[CLS] faster programs make computers run process [SEP] so it's feeding back on itself. [SEP] confusing thing faster [SEP]
[CLS] feeding back [SEP] the thing is becoming faster and that's why i think it seems so confusing. [SEP] technologies feeding back [SEP]
[CLS] confusing thing faster [SEP] because all of these technologies are feeding back on themselves. [SEP] taking [SEP]
[CLS] technologies feeding back [SEP] we're taking off. [SEP] organisms point time analogous single-celled turning multi-celled [SEP]
[CLS] taking [SEP] and what we are is we're at a point in time which is analogous to when single-celled organisms were turning into multi-celled organisms. [SEP] creating amoebas figure hell thing [SEP]
[CLS] organisms point time analogous single-celled turning multi-celled [SEP] so we're the amoebas and we can't quite figure out what the hell this thing is we're creating. [SEP] transition point [SEP]
[CLS] creating amoebas figure hell thing [SEP] we're right at that point of transition. [SEP] coming [SEP]
[CLS] transition point [SEP] but i think that there really is something coming along after us. [SEP] evolution haughty end product [SEP]
[CLS] coming [SEP] i think it's very haughty of us to think that we're the end product of evolution. [SEP] part producing thing [SEP]
[CLS] evolution haughty end product [SEP] and i think all of us here are a part of producing whatever that next thing is. [SEP] point lunch coming stop selected [SEP]
[CLS] part producing thing [SEP] so lunch is coming along, and i think i will stop at that point, before i get selected out. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] my story begins right here actually in rajasthan about two years ago. [SEP] desert ali starry skies sufi singer mukhtiar [SEP]
[CLS] ago story begins rajasthan years [SEP] i was in the desert, under the starry skies with the sufi singer mukhtiar ali. [SEP] epic mahabharata conversation changed time ancient indian [SEP]
[CLS] desert ali starry skies sufi singer mukhtiar [SEP] and we were in conversation about how nothing had changed since the time of the ancient indian epic "the mahabharata." [SEP] day sky back indians wanted travel jump chariot zoom [SEP]
[CLS] epic mahabharata conversation changed time ancient indian [SEP] so back in the day, when us indians wanted to travel we'd jump into a chariot and we'd zoom across the sky. [SEP] airplanes [SEP]
[CLS] day sky back indians wanted travel jump chariot zoom [SEP] now we do the same with airplanes. [SEP] back arjuna prince thirsty bow great indian warrior shoot ground [SEP]
[CLS] airplanes [SEP] back then, when arjuna, the great indian warrior prince, when he was thirsty, he'd take out a bow, he'd shoot it into the ground and water would come out. [SEP] machines drills [SEP]
[CLS] back arjuna prince thirsty bow great indian warrior shoot ground [SEP] now we do the same with drills and machines. [SEP] machinery conclusion magic replaced [SEP]
[CLS] machines drills [SEP] the conclusion that we came to was that magic had been replaced by machinery. [SEP] sad made [SEP]
[CLS] machinery conclusion magic replaced [SEP] and this made me really sad. [SEP] technophobe found bit [SEP]
[CLS] sad made [SEP] i found myself becoming a little bit of a technophobe. [SEP] friends terrified idea lose ability enjoy sunset camera tweeting [SEP]
[CLS] technophobe found bit [SEP] i was terrified by this idea that i would lose the ability to enjoy and appreciate the sunset without having my camera on me, without tweeting it to my friends. [SEP] magic felt technology enable kill [SEP]
[CLS] friends terrified idea lose ability enjoy sunset camera tweeting [SEP] and it felt like technology should enable magic, not kill it. [SEP] girl watch grandfather gave silver pocket [SEP]
[CLS] magic felt technology enable kill [SEP] when i was a little girl, my grandfather gave me his little silver pocket watch. [SEP] technology piece magical thing [SEP]
[CLS] girl watch grandfather gave silver pocket [SEP] and this piece of 50-year-old technology became the most magical thing to me. [SEP] imagination gilded gateway world full pirates shipwrecks images [SEP]
[CLS] technology piece magical thing [SEP] it became a gilded gateway into a world full of pirates and shipwrecks and images in my imagination. [SEP] dreaming felt cellphones fancy watches cameras stopped [SEP]
[CLS] imagination gilded gateway world full pirates shipwrecks images [SEP] so i felt like our cellphones and our fancy watches and our cameras had stopped us from dreaming. [SEP] inspired stopped [SEP]
[CLS] dreaming felt cellphones fancy watches cameras stopped [SEP] they stopped us from being inspired. [SEP] jumped technology world enable magic opposed kill [SEP]
[CLS] inspired stopped [SEP] and so i jumped in, i jumped into this world of technology, to see how i could use it to enable magic as opposed to kill it. [SEP] illustrating books [SEP]
[CLS] jumped technology world enable magic opposed kill [SEP] i've been illustrating books since i was 16. [SEP] ipad world storytelling device connect readers [SEP]
[CLS] illustrating books [SEP] and so when i saw the ipad, i saw it as a storytelling device that could connect readers all over the world. [SEP] holding [SEP]
[CLS] ipad world storytelling device connect readers [SEP] it can know how we're holding it. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] holding [SEP] it can know where we are. [SEP] touch brings image text animation sound [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] it brings together image and text and animation and sound and touch. [SEP] storytelling multi-sensorial [SEP]
[CLS] touch brings image text animation sound [SEP] storytelling is becoming more and more multi-sensorial. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] storytelling multi-sensorial [SEP] but what are we doing with it? [SEP] khoya ipad launch interactive app [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] so i'm actually just going to go in and launch khoya, an interactive app for the ipad. [SEP] place light fingers [SEP]
[CLS] khoya ipad launch interactive app [SEP] so it says, "place your fingers upon each light." [SEP] box belongs type [SEP]
[CLS] place light fingers [SEP] and so -- it says, "this box belongs to..." and so i type in my name. [SEP] book character [SEP]
[CLS] box belongs type [SEP] and actually i become a character in the book. [SEP] points gps letter drops ipad live addressed [SEP]
[CLS] book character [SEP] at various points, a little letter drops down to me -- and the ipad knows where you live because of gps -- which is actually addressed to me. [SEP] possibilities child excited kinds [SEP]
[CLS] points gps letter drops ipad live addressed [SEP] the child in me is really excited by these kinds of possibilities. [SEP] magic talking lot [SEP]
[CLS] possibilities child excited kinds [SEP] now i've been talking a lot about magic. [SEP] dragons magic children wizards kind childhood ideas harbored [SEP]
[CLS] magic talking lot [SEP] and i don't mean wizards and dragons, i mean the kind of childhood magic, those ideas that we all harbored as children. [SEP] jar reason idea fireflies exciting [SEP]
[CLS] dragons magic children wizards kind childhood ideas harbored [SEP] this idea of fireflies in a jar, for some reason, was always really exciting to me. [SEP] ipad tilt fireflies [SEP]
[CLS] jar reason idea fireflies exciting [SEP] and so over here you need to tilt your ipad, take the fireflies out. [SEP] book illuminate rest [SEP]
[CLS] ipad tilt fireflies [SEP] and they actually illuminate your way through the rest of the book. [SEP] marble idea fascinated child entire galaxy contained single [SEP]
[CLS] book illuminate rest [SEP] another idea that really fascinated me as a child was that an entire galaxy could be contained within a single marble. [SEP] device book world marble drag magical [SEP]
[CLS] marble idea fascinated child entire galaxy contained single [SEP] and so over here, each book and each world becomes a little marble that i drag in to this magical device within the device. [SEP] map opens [SEP]
[CLS] device book world marble drag magical [SEP] and it opens up a map. [SEP] static maps fantasy books [SEP]
[CLS] map opens [SEP] all along, all fantasy books have always had maps, but these maps have been static. [SEP] book map grows glows navigation rest [SEP]
[CLS] static maps fantasy books [SEP] this is a map that grows and glows and becomes your navigation for the rest of the book. [SEP] reveals points book [SEP]
[CLS] book map grows glows navigation rest [SEP] it reveals itself to you at certain points in the book as well. [SEP] enter [SEP]
[CLS] reveals points book [SEP] so i'm just going to enter in. [SEP] contemporary thing important creating content indian [SEP]
[CLS] enter [SEP] another thing that's actually really important to me is creating content that is indian and yet very contemporary. [SEP] apsaras [SEP]
[CLS] contemporary thing important creating content indian [SEP] over here, these are the apsaras. [SEP] heard nymphs counterparts apsaras fairies people india indian [SEP]
[CLS] apsaras [SEP] so we've all heard about fairies and we've all heard about nymphs, but how many people outside of india know about their indian counterparts, the apsaras? [SEP] book poor apsaras trapped inside indra chambers thousands years musty [SEP]
[CLS] heard nymphs counterparts apsaras fairies people india indian [SEP] these poor apsaras have been trapped inside indra's chambers for thousands of years in an old and musty book. [SEP] children bringing back contemporary story [SEP]
[CLS] book poor apsaras trapped inside indra chambers thousands years musty [SEP] and so we're bringing them back in a contemporary story for children. [SEP] crisis story deals issues environmental [SEP]
[CLS] children bringing back contemporary story [SEP] and a story that actually deals with new issues like the environmental crisis. [SEP] speaking crisis years rooms glued pcs environmental big problem children [SEP]
[CLS] crisis story deals issues environmental [SEP] speaking of the environmental crisis, i think a big problem has been in the last 10 years is that children have been locked inside their rooms, glued to their pcs, they haven't been able to get out. [SEP] technology mobile children natural world [SEP]
[CLS] speaking crisis years rooms glued pcs environmental big problem children [SEP] but now with mobile technology, we can actually take our children outside into the natural world with their technology. [SEP] objects interactions book quest camera ipad collect pictures natural [SEP]
[CLS] technology mobile children natural world [SEP] one of the interactions in the book is that you're sent off on this quest where you need to go outside, take out your camera on the ipad and collect pictures of different natural objects.

[CLS] system [SEP] it's a complete denial of mistakes. [SEP] outcomes physicians system kinds make mistakes handle sleep deprivation lousy [SEP]
[CLS] mistakes complete denial [SEP] it's a system in which there are two kinds of physicians -- those who make mistakes and those who don't, those who can't handle sleep deprivation and those who can, those who have lousy outcomes and those who have great outcomes.

[CLS]  [SEP] the second story, also to illustrate another concept, is called shifting waistline. [SEP] studying africa lagoon west [SEP]
[CLS] story concept waistline illustrate called shifting [SEP] because i was there in '71, studying a lagoon in west africa. [SEP] africa grew europe wanted work [SEP]
[CLS] studying africa lagoon west [SEP] i was there because i grew up in europe and i wanted later to work in africa. [SEP] thought blend [SEP]

[CLS] percent sponges bottom catch animals fixed [SEP] and actually most of the fish, they are a little spot on the debris, the piles of debris, were coral reef fish. [SEP] essentially bottom sea deck thrown [SEP]
[CLS] fish debris spot piles coral reef [SEP] essentially the bottom of the sea came onto the deck and then was thrown down. [SEP] rapid pictures extraordinary transition [SEP]
[CLS] essentially bottom sea deck thrown [SEP] and these pictures are extraordinary because this transition is very rapid. [SEP] year begins survey commercial fishing [SEP]
[CLS] rapid pictures extraordinary transition [SEP] within a year, you do a survey and then commercial fishing begins. [SEP] case mess bottom transformed hard soft coral muddy [SEP]
[CLS] year begins survey commercial fishing [SEP] the bottom is transformed from, in this case, a hard bottom or soft coral into a muddy mess. [SEP] turtle dead [SEP]

[CLS] eat wanted kill good [SEP] this mountain of debris is actually collected by fishers every time they go into an area that's never been fished. [SEP] documented [SEP]
[CLS] fished mountain debris collected fishers time area [SEP] but it's not documented. [SEP] world transform remember [SEP]

[CLS] world transform remember [SEP] we adjust our baseline to the new level, and we don't recall what was there. [SEP] generalize [SEP]
[CLS] level adjust baseline recall [SEP] if you generalize this, something like this happens. [SEP] biodiversity thing numbers orca country supply axis good greenness water [SEP]
[CLS] generalize [SEP] you have on the y axis some good thing: biodiversity, numbers of orca, the greenness of your country, the water supply. [SEP] things naturally time people [SEP]
[CLS] biodiversity thing numbers orca country supply axis good greenness water [SEP] and over time it changes -- it changes because people do things, or naturally. [SEP] forward generation images beginning conscious lives standard extrapolate [SEP]

[CLS] forward generation images beginning conscious lives standard extrapolate [SEP] and the difference then, they perceive as a loss. [SEP] loss perceive happened [SEP]
[CLS] loss difference perceive [SEP] but they don't perceive what happened before as a loss. [SEP] succession [SEP]
[CLS] loss perceive happened [SEP] you can have a succession of changes. [SEP] leftovers end sustain miserable [SEP]
[CLS] succession [SEP] at the end you want to sustain miserable leftovers. [SEP] extent large [SEP]
[CLS] leftovers end sustain miserable [SEP] and that, to a large extent, is what we want to do now. [SEP] things sustain [SEP]
[CLS] extent large [SEP] we want to sustain things that are gone or things that are not the way they were. [SEP] societies generations problem affected people predatory killed animals [SEP]
[CLS] things sustain [SEP] now one should think this problem affected people certainly when in predatory societies, they killed animals and they didn't know they had done so after a few generations. [SEP] abundant extinct rare animal [SEP]
[CLS] societies generations problem affected people predatory killed animals [SEP] because, obviously, an animal that is very abundant, before it gets extinct, it becomes rare. [SEP] animals lose abundant [SEP]
[CLS] abundant extinct rare animal [SEP] so you don't lose abundant animals. [SEP] animals lose rare [SEP]
[CLS] animals lose abundant [SEP] you always lose rare animals. [SEP] loss perceived big [SEP]
[CLS] animals lose rare [SEP] and therefore they're not perceived as a big loss. [SEP] time animals fish concentrate large sea big [SEP]
[CLS] loss perceived big [SEP] over time, we concentrate on large animals, and in a sea that means the big fish. [SEP] rarer fish [SEP]
[CLS] time animals fish concentrate large sea big [SEP] they become rarer because we fish them. [SEP] baseline time fish left [SEP]
[CLS] rarer fish [SEP] over time we have a few fish left and we think this is the baseline. [SEP] question people accept [SEP]
[CLS] baseline time fish left [SEP] and the question is, why do people accept this? [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS] question people accept [SEP] well because they don't know that it was different. [SEP] scientists fact lots people contest [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] and in fact, lots of people, scientists, will contest that it was really different. [SEP] evidence presented contest earlier mode [SEP]
[CLS] scientists fact lots people contest [SEP] and they will contest this because the evidence presented in an earlier mode is not in the way they would like the evidence presented. [SEP] scientific present captain observed scientists anecdote lots fish area utilized [SEP]
[CLS] evidence presented contest earlier mode [SEP] for example, the anecdote that some present, as captain so-and-so observed lots of fish in this area cannot be used or is usually not utilized by fishery scientists, because it's not "scientific." [SEP] past societies situation people live literate trust sources [SEP]
[CLS] scientific present captain observed scientists anecdote lots fish area utilized [SEP] so you have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we live in literate societies, because they don't trust the sources of the past. [SEP] play enormous role marine protected area [SEP]
[CLS] past societies situation people live literate trust sources [SEP] and hence, the enormous role that a marine protected area can play. [SEP] areas past marine protected recreate [SEP]
[CLS] play enormous role marine protected area [SEP] because with marine protected areas, we actually recreate the past. [SEP] low recreate past people conceive baseline shifted extremely [SEP]
[CLS] areas past marine protected recreate [SEP] we recreate the past that people cannot conceive because the baseline has shifted and is extremely low. [SEP] baseline people marine protected area benefit insight enables reset [SEP]
[CLS] low recreate past people conceive baseline shifted extremely [SEP] that is for people who can see a marine protected area and who can benefit from the insight that it provides, which enables them to reset their baseline. [SEP] people access midwest [SEP]
[CLS] baseline people marine protected area benefit insight enables reset [SEP] how about the people who can't do that because they have no access -- the people in the midwest for example? [SEP] gap simulation arts film fill [SEP]
[CLS] people access midwest [SEP] there i think that the arts and film can perhaps fill the gap, and simulation. [SEP] bay simulation chesapeake [SEP]

[CLS] avatar touched story imagery people mind pocahontas [SEP] because it evokes something that in a sense has been lost. [SEP] underwater recommendation provide avatar cameron [SEP]

[CLS] speech west understand restrict freedom [SEP] we would never do that in our own countries. [SEP] printer page laser today buy color major manufacturer print end [SEP]
[CLS] countries [SEP] but today in 2011, if you go and buy a color laser printer from any major laser printer manufacturer and print a page, that page will end up having slight yellow dots printed on every single page in a pattern which makes the page unique to you and to your printer. [SEP] today happening [SEP]
[CLS] printer page laser today buy color major manufacturer print end [SEP] this is happening to us today. [SEP] making fuss [SEP]
[CLS] today happening [SEP] and nobody seems to be making a fuss about it. [SEP] citizens governments technology [SEP]
[CLS] making fuss [SEP] and this is an example of the ways that our own governments are using technology against us, the citizens. [SEP] today main sources online problems [SEP]
[CLS] citizens governments technology [SEP] and this is one of the main three sources of online problems today. [SEP] world attackers happening online group attacks based [SEP]
[CLS] today main sources online problems [SEP] if we take a look at what's really happening in the online world, we can group the attacks based on the attackers. [SEP] groups main [SEP]
[CLS] world attackers happening online group attacks based [SEP] we have three main groups. [SEP] criminals online [SEP]
[CLS] groups main [SEP] we have online criminals. [SEP] ukraine dimitry golubov city kiev [SEP]
[CLS] criminals online [SEP] like here, we have mr. dimitry golubov from the city of kiev in ukraine. [SEP] understand motives online criminals easy [SEP]
[CLS] ukraine dimitry golubov city kiev [SEP] and the motives of online criminals are very easy to understand. [SEP] money guys make [SEP]
[CLS] understand motives online criminals easy [SEP] these guys make money. [SEP] lots money online attacks make [SEP]
[CLS] money guys make [SEP] they use online attacks to make lots of money, and lots and lots of it. [SEP] multimillionaires online attacks cases millionaires made money [SEP]
[CLS] lots money online attacks make [SEP] we actually have several cases of millionaires online, multimillionaires, who made money with their attacks. [SEP] estonia vladimir tsastsin form tartu [SEP]
[CLS] multimillionaires online attacks cases millionaires made money [SEP] here's vladimir tsastsin form tartu in estonia. [SEP] gonzalez alfred [SEP]
[CLS] estonia vladimir tsastsin form tartu [SEP] this is alfred gonzalez. [SEP] watt stephen [SEP]
[CLS] gonzalez alfred [SEP] this is stephen watt. [SEP] sundin bjorn [SEP]
[CLS] watt stephen [SEP] this is bjorn sundin. [SEP] anderson tariq matthew al-daour [SEP]
[CLS] sundin bjorn [SEP] this is matthew anderson, tariq al-daour and so on and so on. [SEP] online computer make banking guys fortunes illegal things trojans steal [SEP]
[CLS] anderson tariq matthew al-daour [SEP] these guys make their fortunes online, but they make it through the illegal means of using things like banking trojans to steal money from our bank accounts while we do online banking, or with keyloggers to collect our credit card information while we are doing online shopping from an infected computer. [SEP] million bank account secret service ago froze dollars frozen months [SEP]
[CLS] online computer make banking guys fortunes illegal things trojans steal [SEP] the u.s. secret service, two months ago, froze the swiss bank account of mr. sam jain right here, and that bank account had 14.9 million u.s. dollars on it when it was frozen. [SEP] loose jain [SEP]
[CLS] million bank account secret service ago froze dollars frozen months [SEP] mr. jain himself is on the loose; nobody knows where he is. [SEP] world claim today victim crime online real [SEP]
[CLS] loose jain [SEP] and i claim it's already today that it's more likely for any of us to become the victim of a crime online than here in the real world. [SEP] worse obvious [SEP]
[CLS] world claim today victim crime online real [SEP] and it's very obvious that this is only going to get worse. [SEP] future online majority crime happening [SEP]
[CLS] worse obvious [SEP] in the future, the majority of crime will be happening online. [SEP] money major group attackers watching today motivated [SEP]
[CLS] future online majority crime happening [SEP] the second major group of attackers that we are watching today are not motivated by money. [SEP] motivated protests opinion laughs [SEP]
[CLS] money major group attackers watching today motivated [SEP] they're motivated by something else -- motivated by protests, motivated by an opinion, motivated by the laughs. [SEP] groups months attacks anonymous risen major player field online [SEP]
[CLS] motivated protests opinion laughs [SEP] groups like anonymous have risen up over the last 12 months and have become a major player in the field of online attacks. [SEP] attackers criminals money hacktivists protest states governments attacks main anonymous [SEP]
[CLS] groups months attacks anonymous risen major player field online [SEP] so those are the three main attackers: criminals who do it for the money, hacktivists like anonymous doing it for the protest, but then the last group are nation states, governments doing the attacks. [SEP] diginotar cases happened [SEP]
[CLS] attackers criminals money hacktivists protest states governments attacks main anonymous [SEP] and then we look at cases like what happened in diginotar. [SEP] citizens prime governments attack [SEP]
[CLS] diginotar cases happened [SEP] this is a prime example of what happens when governments attack against their own citizens. [SEP] diginotar netherlands certificate authority [SEP]
[CLS] citizens prime governments attack [SEP] diginotar is a certificate authority from the netherlands -- or actually, it was. [SEP] running bankruptcy fall hacked [SEP]
[CLS] diginotar netherlands certificate authority [SEP] it was running into bankruptcy last fall because they were hacked into. [SEP] broke hacked [SEP]
[CLS] running bankruptcy fall hacked [SEP] somebody broke in and they hacked it thoroughly. [SEP] asked representatives hack week meeting dutch government leaders team found [SEP]
[CLS] broke hacked [SEP] and i asked last week in a meeting with dutch government representatives, i asked one of the leaders of the team whether he found plausible that people died because of the diginotar hack. [SEP] answer [SEP]
[CLS] asked representatives hack week meeting dutch government leaders team found [SEP] and his answer was yes. [SEP] people die result hack [SEP]
[CLS] answer [SEP] so how do people die as the result of a hack like this? [SEP] diginotar [SEP]
[CLS] people die result hack [SEP] well diginotar is a c.a. [SEP] certificates sell [SEP]
[CLS] diginotar [SEP] they sell certificates. [SEP] certificates [SEP]
[CLS] certificates sell [SEP] what do you do with certificates? [SEP] https ssl gmail services certificate website encrypted [SEP]
[CLS] certificates [SEP] well you need a certificate if you have a website that has https, ssl encrypted services, services like gmail. [SEP] local services competitors iran connections discussions gmail big part popular [SEP]
[CLS] https ssl gmail services certificate website encrypted [SEP] now we all, or a big part of us, use gmail or one of their competitors, but these services are especially popular in totalitarian states like iran, where dissidents use foreign services like gmail because they know they are more trustworthy than the local services and they are encrypted over ssl connections, so the local government can't snoop on their discussions. [SEP] hack foreign [SEP]
[CLS] local services competitors iran connections discussions gmail big part popular [SEP] except they can if they hack into a foreign c.a. [SEP] certificates issue rogue [SEP]
[CLS] hack foreign [SEP] and issue rogue certificates. [SEP] diginotar happened case [SEP]
[CLS] certificates issue rogue [SEP] and this is exactly what happened with the case of diginotar. [SEP] happening egypt arab spring things [SEP]
[CLS] diginotar happened case [SEP] what about arab spring and things that have been happening, for example, in egypt? [SEP] egypt april papers rioters looted headquarters egyptian secret police looting [SEP]
[CLS] happening egypt arab spring things [SEP] well in egypt, the rioters looted the headquarters of the egyptian secret police in april 2011, and when they were looting the building they found lots of papers. [SEP] finfisher papers entitled binder [SEP]
[CLS] egypt april papers rioters looted headquarters egyptian secret police looting [SEP] among those papers, was this binder entitled "finfisher." [SEP] intercepting scale country binder notes company based germany sold egyptian [SEP]
[CLS] finfisher papers entitled binder [SEP] and within that binder were notes from a company based in germany which had sold the egyptian government a set of tools for intercepting -- and in very large scale -- all the communication of the citizens of the country. [SEP] euros government sold tool egyptian [SEP]
[CLS] intercepting scale country binder notes company based germany sold egyptian [SEP] they had sold this tool for 280,000 euros to the egyptian government. [SEP] company headquarters [SEP]
[CLS] euros government sold tool egyptian [SEP] the company headquarters are right here. [SEP] citizens governments western providing totalitarian tools [SEP]
[CLS] company headquarters [SEP] so western governments are providing totalitarian governments with tools to do this against their own citizens. [SEP] western governments [SEP]
[CLS] citizens governments western providing totalitarian tools [SEP] but western governments are doing it to themselves as well. [SEP] germany found citizens trojan couple weeks ago so-called state german [SEP]
[CLS] western governments [SEP] for example, in germany, just a couple of weeks ago the so-called state trojan was found, which was a trojan used by german government officials to investigate their own citizens. [SEP] case obvious tapped suspect criminal pretty phone [SEP]
[CLS] germany found citizens trojan couple weeks ago so-called state german [SEP] if you are a suspect in a criminal case, well it's pretty obvious, your phone will be tapped. [SEP] today [SEP]
[CLS] case obvious tapped suspect criminal pretty phone [SEP] but today, it goes beyond that. [SEP] connection tap internet [SEP]
[CLS] today [SEP] they will tap your internet connection. [SEP] trojan communication discussions passwords tools state infect computer enables watch [SEP]
[CLS] connection tap internet [SEP] they will even use tools like state trojan to infect your computer with a trojan, which enables them to watch all your communication, to listen to your online discussions, to collect your passwords. [SEP] bad citizen deeper things obvious response people sounds affect legal [SEP]
[CLS] trojan communication discussions passwords tools state infect computer enables watch [SEP] now when we think deeper about things like these, the obvious response from people should be that, "okay, that sounds bad, but that doesn't really affect me because i'm a legal citizen. [SEP] worry [SEP]
[CLS] bad citizen deeper things obvious response people sounds affect legal [SEP] why should i worry? [SEP] hide [SEP]
[CLS] worry [SEP] because i have nothing to hide. " [SEP] argument sense make [SEP]
[CLS] hide [SEP] and this is an argument, which doesn't make sense. [SEP] privacy implied [SEP]
[CLS] argument sense make [SEP] privacy is implied. [SEP] privacy discussion [SEP]
[CLS] privacy implied [SEP] privacy is not up for discussion. [SEP] security question privacy [SEP]
[CLS] privacy discussion [SEP] this is not a question between privacy against security. [SEP] control question freedom [SEP]
[CLS] security question privacy [SEP] it's a question of freedom against control. [SEP] good trust governments give [SEP]
[CLS] control question freedom [SEP] and while we might trust our governments right now, right here in 2011, any right we give away will be given away for good. [SEP] trust years government blindly future [SEP]
[CLS] good trust governments give [SEP] and do we trust, do we blindly trust, any future government, a government we might have 50 years from now? [SEP] years questions worry [SEP]
[CLS] trust years government blindly future [SEP] and these are the questions that we have to worry about for the next 50 years. [SEP]  [SEP]
[CLS]  [SEP] this may sound strange, but i'm a big fan of the concrete block. [SEP] idea modules concrete blocks manufactured simple made cement fixed measurement [SEP]
[CLS] strange block sound big fan concrete [SEP] the first concrete blocks were manufactured in 1868 with a very simple idea: modules made of cement of a fixed measurement that fit together. [SEP] world quickly concrete blocks most-used construction unit [SEP]
[CLS] idea modules concrete blocks manufactured simple made cement fixed measurement [SEP] very quickly concrete blocks became the most-used construction unit in the world. [SEP] buildings bridges time enabled build things larger brick [SEP]
[CLS] world quickly concrete blocks most-used construction unit [SEP] they enabled us to to build things that were larger than us, buildings, bridges, one brick at a time. [SEP] essentially time concrete building blocks block [SEP]
[CLS] buildings bridges time enabled build things larger brick [SEP] essentially concrete blocks had become the building block of our time. [SEP] lego hundred years [SEP]
[CLS] essentially time concrete building blocks block [SEP] almost a hundred years later in 1947, lego came up with this. [SEP] brick called automatic binding [SEP]
[CLS] lego hundred years [SEP] it was called the automatic binding brick. [SEP] years lego household short bricks place [SEP]
[CLS] brick called automatic binding [SEP] and in a few short years, lego bricks took place in every household. [SEP] billion produced planet bricks estimated person [SEP]
[CLS] years lego household short bricks place [SEP] it's estimated that over 400 billion bricks have been produced -- or 75 bricks for every person on the planet. [SEP] beautiful houses bridges buildings engineer make [SEP]
[CLS] billion produced planet bricks estimated person [SEP] you don't have to be an engineer to make beautiful houses, beautiful bridges, beautiful buildings. [SEP] lego accessible made [SEP]
[CLS] beautiful houses bridges buildings engineer make [SEP] lego made it accessible. [SEP] block building lego world imagination essentially concrete made [SEP]
[CLS] lego accessible made [SEP] lego has essentially taken the concrete block, the building block of the world, and made it into the building block of our imagination. [SEP] year announced block exact bell labs revolution building [SEP]
[CLS] block building lego world imagination essentially concrete made [SEP] meanwhile the exact same year, at bell labs the next revolution was about to be announced, the next building block. [SEP] world interactive transistor small plastic unit static bricks piled top [SEP]
[CLS] year announced block exact bell labs revolution building [SEP] the transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of static bricks piled on top of each other to a world where everything was interactive. [SEP] block larger circuits time concrete transistor build complex brick [SEP]
[CLS] world interactive transistor small plastic unit static bricks piled top [SEP] like the concrete block, the transistor allows you to build much larger, more complex circuits, one brick at a time. [SEP] difference experts main transistor [SEP]
[CLS] block larger circuits time concrete transistor build complex brick [SEP] but there's a main difference: the transistor was only for experts. [SEP] experts personally accept building block time reserved decided change [SEP]
[CLS] difference experts main transistor [SEP] i personally don't accept this, that the building block of our time is reserved for experts, so i decided to change that. [SEP] lab designers years ago media started exploring idea put power [SEP]
[CLS] experts personally accept building block time reserved decided change [SEP] eight years ago when i was at the media lab, i started exploring this idea of how to put the power of engineers in the hands of artists and designers. [SEP] littlebits years ago started developing [SEP]
[CLS] lab designers years ago media started exploring idea put power [SEP] a few years ago i started developing littlebits. [SEP] work show [SEP]
[CLS] littlebits years ago started developing [SEP] let me show you how they work. [SEP] littlebits function electronic modules specific [SEP]
[CLS] work show [SEP] littlebits are electronic modules with each one specific function. [SEP] sound light motors sensors pre-engineered [SEP]
[CLS] littlebits function electronic modules specific [SEP] they're pre-engineered to be light, sound, motors and sensors. [SEP] magnets part snap [SEP]
[CLS] sound light motors sensors pre-engineered [SEP] and the best part about it is they snap together with magnets. [SEP] put wrong [SEP]
[CLS] magnets part snap [SEP] so you can't put them the wrong way. [SEP] color-coded bricks [SEP]
[CLS] put wrong [SEP] the bricks are color-coded. [SEP] green output blue power pink wire input orange [SEP]
[CLS] color-coded bricks [SEP] green is output, blue is power, pink is input and orange is wire. [SEP] circuits snap blue green quickly start making larger [SEP]
[CLS] green output blue power pink wire input orange [SEP] so all you need to do is snap a blue to a green and very quickly you can start making larger circuits. [SEP] green light put blue make [SEP]
[CLS] circuits snap blue green quickly start making larger [SEP] you put a blue to a green, you can make light. [SEP] dimmer put knob made [SEP]
[CLS] green light put blue make [SEP] you can put a knob in between and now you've made a little dimmer. [SEP] switch module blinker knob pulse made [SEP]
[CLS] dimmer put knob made [SEP] switch out the knob for a pulse module, which is here, and now you've made a little blinker. [SEP] add machine buzzer extra punch created noise [SEP]
[CLS] switch module blinker knob pulse made [SEP] add this buzzer for some extra punch and you've created a noise machine. [SEP] stop [SEP]
[CLS] add machine buzzer extra punch created noise [SEP] i'm going to stop that. [SEP] play littlebits powerful simple pretty [SEP]
[CLS] stop [SEP] so beyond simple play, littlebits are actually pretty powerful. [SEP] program wire solder littlebits gestures simple intuitive [SEP]
[CLS] play littlebits powerful simple pretty [SEP] instead of having to program, to wire, to solder, littlebits allow you to program using very simple intuitive gestures. [SEP] slower faster make blink turn knob basically pulse [SEP]
[CLS] program wire solder littlebits gestures simple intuitive [SEP] so to make this blink faster or slower, you would just turn this knob and basically make it pulse faster or slower. [SEP] library idea littlebits growing [SEP]
[CLS] slower faster make blink turn knob basically pulse [SEP] the idea behind littlebits is that it's a growing library. [SEP] brick make single interaction world [SEP]
[CLS] library idea littlebits growing [SEP] we want to make every single interaction in the world into a ready-to-use brick. [SEP] lights sounds motors solar panels accessible [SEP]
[CLS] brick make single interaction world [SEP] lights, sounds, solar panels, motors -- everything should be accessible. [SEP] giving littlebits kids play [SEP]
[CLS] lights sounds motors solar panels accessible [SEP] we've been giving littlebits to kids and seeing them play with them. [SEP] experience incredible [SEP]
[CLS] giving littlebits kids play [SEP] and it's been an incredible experience. [SEP] schools nicest thing start understand electronics everyday learn [SEP]
[CLS] experience incredible [SEP] the nicest thing is how they start to understand the electronics around them from everyday that they don't learn at schools. [SEP] works open touch nightlight elevator door stays ipod responds [SEP]
[CLS] schools nicest thing start understand electronics everyday learn [SEP] for example, how a nightlight works, or why an elevator door stays open, or how an ipod responds to touch. [SEP] schools taking littlebits design [SEP]
[CLS] works open touch nightlight elevator door stays ipod responds [SEP] we've also been taking littlebits to design schools. [SEP] material designers experience electronics whatsoever start play littlebits [SEP]
[CLS] schools taking littlebits design [SEP] so for example, we've had designers with no experience with electronics whatsoever start to play with littlebits as a material. [SEP] bottles making felt paper water geordie [SEP]
[CLS] material designers experience electronics whatsoever start play littlebits [SEP] here you see, with felt and paper water bottles, we have geordie making... [SEP] whatsoever cardboard wood paper make weeks ago littlebits risd gave [SEP]
[CLS] bottles making felt paper water geordie [SEP] a few weeks ago we took littlebits to risd and gave them to some designers with no experience in engineering whatsoever -- just cardboard, wood and paper -- and told them "make something." [SEP] made ball project motion-activated confetti canon [SEP]
[CLS] whatsoever cardboard wood paper make weeks ago littlebits risd gave [SEP] here's an example of a project they made, a motion-activated confetti canon ball. [SEP] wait project favorite [SEP]
[CLS] made ball project motion-activated confetti canon [SEP] but wait, this is actually my favorite project. [SEP] dark lobster made playdough afraid [SEP]
[CLS] wait project favorite [SEP] it's a lobster made of playdough that's afraid of the dark. [SEP] material non-engineers littlebits electronics [SEP]
[CLS] dark lobster made playdough afraid [SEP] to these non-engineers, littlebits became another material, electronics became just another material. [SEP] make material accessible [SEP]
[CLS] material non-engineers littlebits electronics [SEP] and we want to make this material accessible to everyone. [SEP] open-source littlebits [SEP]
[CLS] make material accessible [SEP] so littlebits is open-source. [SEP] website download files make design [SEP]
[CLS] open-source littlebits [SEP] you can go on the website, download all the design files, make them yourself. [SEP] world creators inventors contributors encourage live interactive [SEP]
[CLS] website download files make design [SEP] we want to encourage a world of creators, of inventors, of contributors, because this world that we live in, this interactive world, is ours. [SEP] inventing ahead start [SEP]
[CLS] world creators inventors contributors encourage live interactive [SEP] so go ahead and start inventing. [SEP]  [SEP]
