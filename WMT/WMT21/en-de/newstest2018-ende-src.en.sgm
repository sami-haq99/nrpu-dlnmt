<seg id="1">Munich 1856: Four maps that will change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">A mental asylum, where today young people are said to meet.</seg>
<seg id="3">A crypt chapel, where they are now digging tunnels for the S-Bahn.</seg>
<seg id="4">Allotment holders cultivate the soil of former farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich brings captivating stories to light.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying when geographical maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Anyone who has ever got worked up because the car's sat-nav is showing a green field instead of a bypass knows that.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital BayernAtlas, an offering from the State Government's Geoportal Bayern, are anything but up-to-date – and yet it is precisely for this reason that they are so informative.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when one compares them with current online maps.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how the towns and municipalities in the distribution area of Munich's Merkur newspaper have changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital BayernAtlas is a patchwork quilt that one doesn't quite recognise for what it is at first.</seg>
<seg id="12">Within the large overview map, were worked in detailed maps for towns and municipalities, so-called original-lay-of-the-land sheets.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to information from the Bavarian Surveying and Mapping Authority, these came into being between 1810 and 1864 and arise out of the first survey of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Their commissioner: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army commander had occupied Bavaria since the spring in 1800, during the War of the Second Coalition with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted to gain an overview of the occupied land and commissioned a topographical survey – naturally for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if the French troops finally retreated with the Treaty of Lunéville from 9th February 1801: it was the current neighbours who had the idea to create a comprehensive map of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="18">Elector Max IV. Joseph propelled the project further forward, founding the "Topographical Bureau" – and with that, the Bavarian Surveying and Mapping Authority.</seg>
<seg id="19">The original lay-of-the-land sheet for Munich originates from 1856 and, like all the others, can be found on the website of the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of past/present is most impressive taking the example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has stretched out in all directions and coalesced.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is Untersendling, which still appears relatively isolated on the map from 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was incorporated as an urban district of Munich 21 years after the map was created.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling lies in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">Around 1856, Untersendling's houses are concentrated along what is today Plinganserstraße, which was first named in 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a ringleader of the Bavarian farmers' revolt against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where the West Park is today, one sees nothing but field – at first sight: upon zooming in, a more detailed small-scale map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: hand-numbered plots from the so-called "original record", from which the property tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">Today, it is no longer farmers who occupy small parcels there – rather, it is allotment holders of the "Land in Sonne" facility.</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is apparent to the north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">Theresienwiese, since 1810 the scene of Oktoberfest, was in the 19th century still actually a "Wiese" – a meadow – and not a concrete wasteland.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the original lay-of-the-land sheet, in the area where today the borough of Au-Haidhausen is, one can make out not only the street name "am Gasteig" or the elevation "Auf der Lüften" – but can actually read in large letters "mental asylum".</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here on Auerfeldstraße, they once imprisoned people with delusions.</seg>
<seg id="33">The Munich district mental asylum "Auf der Auer Lüften" had come to life there in 1858/59.</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the institution – the psychiatrist who is associated with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"He was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the practice of chaining up the so-called mad men.</seg>
<seg id="36">What is more, he forbade the staff from using violence against the inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, leader of the Haidhausen Museum, which has been busying itself for an exhibition with the establishment.</seg>
<seg id="37">Originally there was place for 280 patients; later this was expanded to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point even this capacity was no longer enough – the reason why the district mental asylum in Haar was constructed in 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Isar Amper Clinic, East Munich, has been located there since 2006, one of the largest psychiatric units in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="40">On the plot of the former Auer institution, young people now meet in the Munich Salesianum.</seg>
<seg id="41">The order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth centre with training programmes.</seg>
<seg id="42">To the west lies the football pitch of TSV München Ost, and to the east, residential houses from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015, the "Casa Don Bosco" nursery was built – in the architectural style of the original mental asylum building, which had been destroyed in the Second World War in bomb attacks.</seg>
<seg id="44">Marienplatz was recorded as the "main square" in around 1856, and Kaufingerstraße was called "Kaufinger Gasse".</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also brought a decisive change to the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of the Allies tore many holes in the city centre in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">One big one remains up to this day – at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small commercial premises and a crypt chapel from the Middle Ages once stood in the Marienhof, where these days, preparations for the second S-Bahn main line are underway, with first digging to follow on 5th April 2017.</seg>
<seg id="49">You can use the slider control to compare the old Munich map with the aerial view from today – and to fill in the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>

<seg id="1">Civil rights group issues travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="2">The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has put out an alert for people of color traveling to Missouri because of the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="3">"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, effective through August 28th, 2017, calls for African American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when traveling throughout the state given the series of questionable, race-based incidents occurring statewide recently, and noted therein," the group's statement reads.</seg>
<seg id="4">A recent Missouri law making it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the state's law enforcement disproportionately targeting minorities prompted the group to issue the travel alert, the NAACP said.</seg>
<seg id="5">"You have violations of civil rights that are happening to people.</seg>
<seg id="6">They're being pulled over because of their skin color, they're being beaten up or killed," the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, told The Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="7">"We are hearing complaints at a rate we haven't heard before."</seg>
<seg id="8">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the US.</seg>
<seg id="9">The group cited incidents such as racial slurs against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sanders died under questionable circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas while traveling through the state, and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="11">The advisory also points to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General's Office showing that black drivers in the state were 75 percent more likely to be pulled over than whites.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The advisory is for people to be aware, and warn their families and friends and co-workers of what could happen in Missouri," Chapel said.</seg>
<seg id="13">"People need to be ready, whether it's bringing bail money with them, or letting relatives know they are traveling through the state."</seg>
<seg id="14">Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, ranking the state at 16th in the country in terms of the number of such violations.</seg>
<seg id="15">The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a business for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="16">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel advisories for Texas and Arizona after the states passed immigration enforcement laws requiring local law enforcement to detain people on immigration violations which the ACLU said would increase racial profiling.</seg>
<seg id="17">Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately, advocacy groups have resorted to the measure in response to certain laws and trends inside the US.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pasture fence project is fundamental</seg>
<seg id="2">The Fischerbach pasture fence project is a successful project and will be continued next year.</seg>
<seg id="3">Members of the Bundestag for the CDU Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac got a first-hand view.</seg>
<seg id="4">Representatives from the Fischerbach local CDU group met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two representatives at Rechtgrabenhof farm, belonging to the Schwendemann family.</seg>
<seg id="5">To start with, Markus Schwendemann gave insights into his business, in which he cultivates 55 hectares of pasture and 40 hectares of woodland, keeps 40 milk cows and just as many young stock, and accommodates five apartments of holiday makers.</seg>
<seg id="6">Schwendemann says that, for him, there is no alternative to the "Black Forest milk" marketing channel he uses for the milk from his cows.</seg>
<seg id="7">Only regional produce is served to the holiday-makers.</seg>
<seg id="8">Since he is also BLHV chairman for Fischerbach, he described the pasture fence project as "fundamentally important".</seg>
<seg id="9">I can't make a profit on that kind of steep-sloping ground.</seg>
<seg id="10">Grassland areas make for a lot of work, a lot has to be done with the string trimmer.</seg>
<seg id="11">"We have to grapple with the conditions and with the topography here," stressed Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="12">In 2003, he took over his parents' business and he manages this without chemical crop protection and fertilisers, even if it's not an organic farm that he's running.</seg>
<seg id="13">For Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear that "the community has recognised the importance of the pasture fence project and is happy to have the Leader funding".</seg>
<seg id="14">The farmers need support to the tune of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare.</seg>
<seg id="15">One hopes that with that, afforestation of the area could then be drawn out for a long while.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The biggest asset that we have are the people who work in agriculture and who give thought to how to bring their businesses forward," stressed the mayor.</seg>
<seg id="17">The farmers are often the target of criticism thanks to the funding.</seg>
<seg id="18">Using the pasture fence funding, a total of 25 plots from eleven participants were fenced off in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="19">The areas kept open with these amount to 40 hectares, which may not be afforested until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="20">Of the total costs, to the tune of 71,500 euros, half was funded via Leader, and a quarter was borne by the community of Fischerbach.</seg>
<seg id="21">The farmers were thus left with 12,610 euros, which they had to invest in the 16.2-kilometre pasture fence.</seg>
<seg id="22">"The great advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="23">Kordula Kovac stressed: "You're doing a really good job. Without farmers we'd not be able to function."</seg>
<seg id="24">Peter Weiß is also standing firm: "First-class foodstuffs are produced here."</seg>
<seg id="25">The Baden-Württemberg directive on countryside conservation (LPR) makes the government funding of pasture fences possible.</seg>
<seg id="26">Its goal is to keep the Black Forest open.</seg>
<seg id="27">A prerequisite is the existence of one of the funding scenarios as outlined by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="28">In addition, the fenced-off area is not allowed to be farmable with a tractor (gradient of over 35 per cent) and must therefore be threatened with afforestation.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the 2018 Fischerbach pasture fence project, an application is currently underway from eight participants with 24 plots who would like to build just shy of 16 kilometres of fence.</seg>
<seg id="30">The areas of land to be kept open equate to 35 hectares; the calculated costs amount to more than 112,000 euros.</seg>

<seg id="1">Is nothing sacred?</seg>
<seg id="2">Now Trump's White House is targeting the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="3">The surest mark of regime change is when they start attacking the statues.</seg>
<seg id="4">Americans appreciate this as well as anyone - hence the carefully stage-manged toppling of Saddam Hussein in Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="5">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, surely knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe to the Statue of Liberty in a heated argument with CNN's Jim Acosta over the president's proposals to drastically limit legal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fairness, Miller did not attack the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="7">A horde of boat-trip owners and Liberty impersonators would have lynched him if he did.</seg>
<seg id="8">But he did attack its meaning, and in particular the meaning ascribed to it when Emma Lazarus's famous poem was added to its base in 1903, 17 years after the monument itself was completed.</seg>
<seg id="9">As Miller scolded Acosta: "I don't want to get off into a whole thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American liberty lighting the world.</seg>
<seg id="10">The poem that you're referring to, that was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="11">Miller is factually correct, but as he put it himself, this is not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus's startling words, the only ones in which a state has appeared to invite not just any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, / The wretched refuse of your teeming shore."</seg>
<seg id="13">There has never been a time when the "wretched refuse" has been more visible on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="14">Miller was not engaging in literary criticism - he was making it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump's USA.</seg>
<seg id="15">This conflict about the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural war: it is really a conflict about the meaning of America.</seg>
<seg id="16">Lazarus - and her friends who campaigned to place her words at the base after her death - knew very well that they were engaging in a highly political act.</seg>
<seg id="17">The sculpture was intended to mark the connections between French and American republicanism by representing in a well-worn classical trope, the female embodiment of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="18">Lazarus changed that meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has a voice.</seg>
<seg id="19">And she gives herself a very different name: Mother of Exiles.</seg>
<seg id="20">The marrying of the poem to the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.</seg>
<seg id="21">And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, rightwingers have long wanted to change it back.</seg>
<seg id="22">The great loudmouth Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that Liberty is not inviting anyone in, but is rather an early neocon, taking the American flame out to the benighted world: "Lady Liberty is stepping forward.</seg>
<seg id="23">She is meant to be carrying the torch of liberty from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="24">The torch is not to light the way to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="25">Rather unusually, Limbaugh actually hit on something.</seg>
<seg id="26">The meaning of the statue is entirely a matter of the angle of perception.</seg>
<seg id="27">Lazarus's great imaginative act was to see it as it would be seen by exhausted, wretched but hopeful people on the decks of ships after long and often dreadful journeys.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is literally about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to better their lives.</seg>
<seg id="29">Her statue speaks back to them the words of hope and welcome they need to hear.</seg>
<seg id="30">And of course, this is not the perspective Miller and Trump want ever to recognise.</seg>
<seg id="31">Their torch is meant not to light the way, but to inflame the hatreds that are their only source of power.</seg>

<seg id="1">World Championships 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of Team GB</seg>
<seg id="2">Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two Scots made the GB team</seg>
<seg id="3">UK Athletics' performance director Neil Black says the 16-strong Scottish contingent in the World Championships squad will make "a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="4">A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="5">Black believes "there's something special evolving" in Scotland and UK athletics must learn from that.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We embrace it and we're trying to understand it and we'll push on that until we work it out," Black said.</seg>
<seg id="7">"I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it's something to do with what they've done.</seg>
<seg id="8">Scottish Athletics think it's something to do with what they've done.</seg>
<seg id="9">British athletics: it's something to do with what they've done.</seg>
<seg id="10">And the guy on the corner street, too.</seg>
<seg id="11">Whatever the combination of circumstances, it's absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="12">Several of the Scottish athletes are medal contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will race against Sir Mo Farah in the 5,000m, while Eilidh Doyle was voted by the squad to be team captain.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Eilidh is slightly modest.</seg>
<seg id="14">Her captain's speech was incredible," says Black.</seg>
<seg id="15">"A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, walked out of that room feeling hugely proud and really motivated.</seg>
<seg id="16">The passion and real feeling that Eilidh naturally put into it were great."</seg>
<seg id="17">The Commonwealth silver medallist, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at her fifth World Championships, says it's "incredible" 16 Scots are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="18">Scotland's previous best total of athletes at the worlds was seven, achieved in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="19">Middle-distance runner Muir is leading the way, having set five British and two European records in the past year.</seg>
<seg id="20">She will go in the 1500m and the 5,000m.</seg>
<seg id="21">Chris O'Hare, who runs in the 1500m, is another Scot to watch, following a great season that included victory at the British Team trials and the Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="22">Doyle remembers her first world championships, when the only other Scot in the team was Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="23">The team captain says she's "hugely proud" of the fact so many of her compatriots have not only made the team, but, in some cases, will be challenging for medals and competing to make finals.</seg>
<seg id="24">"The special thing about being team captain is that it was voted for by the other members of the team, so that it was such a huge honour anyway but to know that your teammates have voted for you and chosen you made it extra-special for me," she added.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Obviously, I'm very proud of all the Scots who've made the team.</seg>
<seg id="26">It just shows how far we've come.</seg>
<seg id="27">And they're here as well-established athletes, athletes that are going to be looking to get on podiums.</seg>
<seg id="28">As for my captain's speech?</seg>
<seg id="29">Yeah, I think it went well.</seg>
<seg id="30">I just drew on the fact that we're very lucky in this situation in that we've got a home World Championships.</seg>
<seg id="31">So it's really just the importance of drawing on that home support and thriving on the fact that we're back at the Olympic Stadium.</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm getting a second chance to go out there and compete and it's just going to be such an amazing atmosphere out there."</seg>

<seg id="1">Blocking critics from Facebook: Don't run for public office, if you can't take heat from voters</seg>
<seg id="2">The father of our country knew something about bad press.</seg>
<seg id="3">Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for newspapers to start slamming him on everything from domestic policy to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="4">He chafed at the criticism, sure.</seg>
<seg id="5">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="6">Because back in 1783, Washington said, "the freedom of Speech may be taken away - and, dumb & silent we may be led, like sheep, to the Slaughter."</seg>
<seg id="7">That brings me to Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who needs to work on being more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hogan's staff has blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who voiced their opinions on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="9">And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for that earlier this week.</seg>
<seg id="10">The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online commentary was rich with a "who cares?" backlash.</seg>
<seg id="11">"It's only Facebook," plenty of folks said.</seg>
<seg id="12">But it matters.</seg>
<seg id="13">And it especially matters when it's a guy like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="14">This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly Democratic state who is astonishingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="15">He has the second-highest approval rating of the nation's 50 governors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Hogan is not a reactionary hothead.</seg>
<seg id="17">He's shown a steady hand in leading his state and a stern adherence to principles.</seg>
<seg id="18">He's also been pretty deft at using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his constituents, playfully debuting his hairless head after chemo treatments on his page.</seg>
<seg id="19">So blocking people who come to the governor's page - which is a public forum, labeled as official and administered by staff members paid public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="20">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions, arguing that blocking the comments was nothing more than moderating them.</seg>
<seg id="21">But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful folks lashing out online.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Post talked to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="23">And they're just that - real people talking to their elected leaders: a teacher, a business owner and a pastor, not trolls.</seg>
<seg id="24">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.</seg>
<seg id="25">The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, appealing to Hogan's Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="26">Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., wasn't hateful, but she asked about hate crimes.</seg>
<seg id="27">"I politely commented that I was disappointed in his lack of response to hate crimes and other recent news items," she wrote in the comment section of The Post's news story.</seg>
<seg id="28">"I also do not appreciate that idea that when a number of people comment on the same topic, they are immediately disregarded by some as a so-called collective effort, rather than recognized as a large group of concerned citizens."</seg>
<seg id="29">What the governor's staff called a "concentrated spam attack" others would probably call "advocacy."</seg>
<seg id="30">The Facebook era makes it easy to tailor a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="31">It's a lot cleaner than the old days, when doing the same would have required sending staff out to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or arresting and silencing protesters.</seg>
<seg id="32">But that's exactly what's happening, only digitally.</seg>
<seg id="33">Hogan isn't the first public official to be criticized for defanging Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="34">President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who were blocked from his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="35">One of the first landmark rulings on this issue came down last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="36">The chair of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a constituent from her Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="37">And in Kentucky, Gov. Matt Bevin (R) also got a visit from the ACLU over his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="38">This shouldn't be so hard.</seg>
<seg id="39">In Washington's time, the era of affordable postage had an impact much like the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="40">The number of newspapers quadrupled between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers hammered his leadership.</seg>
<seg id="41">And even back then, Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="42">People using the pseudonyms "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius," and "Portius" all wrote letters to newspapers trashing Washington's decisions.</seg>
<seg id="43">Petitions criticizing his stand on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online Papers of George Washington Project.</seg>
<seg id="44">But he did not silence them.</seg>
<seg id="45">Freedom of speech, dissent and discourse lie at the very foundation of our nation.</seg>
<seg id="46">And true leadership means accepting that.</seg>

<seg id="2">In past two decades, an ever decreasing number of people have died from lung cancer due to passive smoking.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is the conclusion drawn by scientists from the University Medical Centre Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) in a study.</seg>
<seg id="4">"According to our estimations, 167 lung cancer deaths a year can be attributed to passive smoking," said study leader Heiko Becher.</seg>
<seg id="5">For comparison, he referred to one of his own studies on this topic from 1994.</seg>
<seg id="6">Back then, there were still 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking every year in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="7">The new study is published in the "International Journal of Public Health".</seg>

<seg id="3">In terms of home connections, the situation is more complicated than expected, since lots of things are hidden in the substrate that were not noted in the plans.</seg>
<seg id="4">The traffic, which always disrupts building works, poses a big problem for the Stumpp company construction crew.</seg>

<seg id="1">Poverty and Death in Indonesia's Land of Gold</seg>
<seg id="2">When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.</seg>
<seg id="3">She rarely even uses a pot.</seg>
<seg id="4">In her wooden home in Enarotali, the capital of Paniai regency in the restive Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually just places a sweet potato - known locally as "nota" - directly into the fireplace.</seg>
<seg id="5">After half-an-hour, the charred tuber is retrieved and devoured with eager, unwashed hands.</seg>
<seg id="6">Degei sits on the mud floor - she has no furniture - which is where she also performs her daily chores, such as washing clothes with murky water from the nearby swamp.</seg>
<seg id="7">A bucket in a roofless room serves as a latrine.</seg>
<seg id="8">As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she has been assigned no fields to tend.</seg>
<seg id="9">Polygamy is common here.</seg>
<seg id="10">Of course, working late can be dangerous: Most of the village men are unemployed and many drink heavily, plus there are the soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="11">"No one dares to walk around the village after 5 p.m.," she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">It's a rare glimpse of daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was absorbed into Indonesia in 1969 following a controversial referendum, when just 1,026 elders were forced to vote through a public show of hands before occupying troops.</seg>
<seg id="13">An existing movement agitating for independence against Dutch rule swiftly turned its ire against the Jakarta government, which maintains tight control over the region, barring foreign journalists or rights monitors.</seg>
<seg id="14">In 2003, the province was officially split into Papua and West Papua, with independent Papua New Guinea occupying the eastern part of the island.</seg>
<seg id="15">Enarotali is as remote as it is desolate; the journey here involves a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire, and then a stomach-churning five-hour drive by hire car.</seg>
<seg id="16">There is no public transport.</seg>
<seg id="17">The town of some 19,000 people consists of wooden houses ringed by bamboo fencing, corrugated iron roofs transformed by rust into varying tawny shades.</seg>
<seg id="18">Very few Indonesians have made the journey here, let alone journalists, and practically no foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="19">Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshiped a God named Uga Tamee.</seg>
<seg id="20">There were other changes, too.</seg>
<seg id="21">"We were not used to wearing these clothes," says Degei, indicating her vividly colored, hand-woven turban, dark shirt and a bright skirt.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Before, we only wore leaves on our bodies."</seg>
<seg id="23">Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and with some of the worst infant mortality and literacy rates in Asia.</seg>
<seg id="24">But it is also Indonesia's land of gold.</seg>
<seg id="25">The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, lies just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province around the size of New Jersey and home to 153,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="26">In 2015 alone, Freeport mined some $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper here.</seg>
<seg id="27">In addition, Papua boasts timber resources worth an estimated $78 billion.</seg>
<seg id="28">These riches are, however, a source of misery for Papuans, ensuring Indonesia's powerful military maintains a suffocating presence.</seg>
<seg id="29">A 2005 investigation in The New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.</seg>
<seg id="30">Papuan calls for greater autonomy threaten this golden goose, and are dealt with mercilessly.</seg>
<seg id="31">According to rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.</seg>
<seg id="32">Mass killings in Papua's tribal highlands during the 1970s amounted to genocide, according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.</seg>
<seg id="33">Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region last year alone.</seg>
<seg id="34">We Will Lose Everything, a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, contains testimony of atrocities committed the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture - rape and electrocution are especially popular, according to another report - and the brutal crushing of peaceful demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="35">"It's difficult to count the number of victims as incidents happen every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="36">The screws have tightened as Papua's resources bring an influx of settlers from elsewhere in Indonesia.</seg>
<seg id="37">The province's 3.5 million population is 83% Christian, but the demographic is changing as Muslim economic migrants arrive from Indonesia's populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.</seg>
<seg id="38">Javanese warung canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado mixed-vegetables served with peanut sauce.</seg>
<seg id="39">Local people struggle to compete.</seg>
<seg id="40">"The migrants started to sell chicken and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papuans," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to the provincial capital Jayapura for work.</seg>
<seg id="41">"It made the native Papuans - the mama-mama [the women] of Papua - lose their market."</seg>
<seg id="42">Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, vowed to address the inequalities and rights abuses in Papua during his election campaign in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="43">The former carpenter secured 27 of Papua's total 29 districts - including Paniai - on the way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta.</seg>
<seg id="44">But precious little has changed in Papua, and today local people feel betrayed.</seg>
<seg id="45">"Our hearts have been broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi, with the expectation that he would fulfill our hopes for justice to be restored," You says.</seg>
<seg id="46">In fact, Paniai suffered a nadir just two months after Jokowi's October inauguration.</seg>
<seg id="47">On Dec. 7, 2014 a group of 11 children were outside singing Christmas carols in front of a bonfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorbike broke through the gloom.</seg>
<seg id="48">The startled children told them that they should turn on their headlights.</seg>
<seg id="49">One of the soldiers took umbrage at their tone and later returned with four soldiers, according to local Pastor Yavedt Tebai.</seg>
<seg id="50">The soldiers, who had been drinking, chased and beat the group with their rifle butts, said victims and witnesses.</seg>
<seg id="51">Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.</seg>
<seg id="52">One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly he fell into a coma.</seg>
<seg id="53">A couple of hours later, the nearby government Election Commission building was set ablaze, and things escalated the following day.</seg>
<seg id="54">About 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered on a soccer field in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.</seg>
<seg id="55">They carried ceremonial hunting bows and performed the waita dance - running in circles and simulating birdsong - of Papua's Mee Pago tribe.</seg>
<seg id="56">Some protesters started hurling stones at police and military posts.</seg>
<seg id="57">As tempers grew more heated, an order was sent to the soldiers through internal radio: "If the masses offer resistance more than three times, shoot them dead," it said, according to an official document seen by TIME that has not been released to the local media.</seg>
<seg id="58">Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto neighborhood of Enarotali, saw the impending danger and appealed for calm, imploring the crowd to go back home.</seg>
<seg id="59">Nobody was in the mood to listen.</seg>
<seg id="60">"When I turned around I suddenly got shot in my left wrist," he told TIME on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.</seg>
<seg id="61">Kayame still doesn't know who fired but says the bullet came from the ranks of amassed soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="62">"It was crowded, many shots were fired," he adds.</seg>
<seg id="63">Local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin who witnessed the shootings.</seg>
<seg id="64">"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," Yohanes, who like many Indonesians only goes by one name, told TIME somberly.</seg>
<seg id="65">"I saw he was dead ... I kissed him."</seg>
<seg id="66">The Papua Police Chief Inspector General Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers were only "securing" their station because it was under attack.</seg>
<seg id="67">"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," Papua Police spokesperson, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="68">"It's a matter of life and death."</seg>
<seg id="69">According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more injured.</seg>
<seg id="70">News of the killings only filtered through to Jakarta the following day.</seg>
<seg id="71">Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an impassioned speech in Jayapura, where he expressed sympathies with the victims' families and vowed to address the historic abuses in Papua.</seg>
<seg id="72">"I want this case to be solved immediately so it won't ever happen again in the future," he said.</seg>
<seg id="73">Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was setting up a non-judicial mechanism to settle historic human-rights violations.</seg>
<seg id="74">But the excuses started almost immediately.</seg>
<seg id="75">"Most of the violations occurred a long time ago.</seg>
<seg id="76">Some were in the '90s and in early 2000s.</seg>
<seg id="77">The point is we are committed to addressing these violations, but there are processes to go through," he said.</seg>
<seg id="78">Then Wiranto backtracked when speaking to TIME in Jakarta on June 5, saying he has no plans to establish a grievance mechanism in Papua.</seg>
<seg id="79">Instead, "All will be settled by law," he said.</seg>
<seg id="80">Wiranto, who the U.N. has indicted for "crimes against humanity" relating to more than 1,000 deaths during East Timor's bloody 1999 independence vote, said that 11 cases of human-rights violations in Papua have already been settled, including the Paniai incident.</seg>
<seg id="81">Families of the Paniai victims greeted such claims with grim incredulity.</seg>
<seg id="82">"I've been interviewed four times for the past three years, but there has been no progress at all," Yohanes says.</seg>
<seg id="83">"I'm tired."</seg>
<seg id="84">He says that years later, he still lives in fear.</seg>
<seg id="85">"I'm afraid," he says.</seg>
<seg id="86">"I'm afraid of being arrested by the military, afraid to be shot."</seg>
<seg id="87">His brother Yacobus echoed the view that people in Paniai are fearful of discussing the incident.</seg>
<seg id="88">He says he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims.</seg>
<seg id="89">"After burying the bodies, the military came looking for me," he says.</seg>
<seg id="90">The shootings haven't stopped.</seg>
<seg id="91">On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers in Paniai's neighboring Deiyai regency.</seg>
<seg id="92">One person died and 17 others were wounded, including children, during a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to help transport an unconscious man to hospital.</seg>
<seg id="93">The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw who drowned while he was fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to hospital.</seg>
<seg id="94">Incensed villagers protested in front of the company's site office.</seg>
<seg id="95">Police said the villagers threw rocks at officers, who responded by firing warning shots.</seg>
<seg id="96">But locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd, killing one.</seg>
<seg id="97">"We were so panicked, we are afraid there will be revenge," 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the injured being hurried in, tells TIME.</seg>
<seg id="98">"I have been hiding in my house for two days."</seg>
<seg id="99">The Deiyai parliament has called for the officers involved to be held to account and the police mobile brigade to be withdrawn from the area.</seg>
<seg id="100">Paniai has always been a troublespot for the Indonesian government.</seg>
<seg id="101">The lack of meaningful development feeds the discontent of the tribal Mee, Moni, Dani, and Damal peoples, who live sprawled across Papua's verdant central highlands.</seg>
<seg id="102">Many joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of the Papuans by launching sporadic attacks and kidnapping raids on Indonesian soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="103">Some of the top OPM leaders hail from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.</seg>
<seg id="104">In response, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily detained by the military in recent years, under the guise of "safeguarding national sovereignty."</seg>
<seg id="105">Some never reappear.</seg>
<seg id="106">Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place."</seg>
<seg id="107">Poverty feeds the discontent.</seg>
<seg id="108">The little rice on sale in Enarotali is too expensive for locals to buy.</seg>
<seg id="109">Bread is just as out of reach.</seg>
<seg id="110">People here grow everything they eat: mainly nota plus some fruit and leafy vegetables.</seg>
<seg id="111">Farming is the job of the women, who each can maintain four or five fields of the sweet potato.</seg>
<seg id="112">They usually keep most of the harvest for the family, with the rest sold in the local market.</seg>
<seg id="113">Ten pieces of nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupiah (75 cents).</seg>
<seg id="114">Over time, economic inequalities have grown between the native Papuans and the new migrants, who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of a new air routes to Nabire Airport.</seg>
<seg id="115">What few jobs exist typically go to the better-educated and wealthier migrants.</seg>
<seg id="116">Papuans rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to run their own businesses competitively.</seg>
<seg id="117">"The young people are not interested to stay in the village ... because there's no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council of Paniai.</seg>
<seg id="118">Isolation keeps the world's eyes off Papua.</seg>
<seg id="119">In addition, reporting restrictions for international media remain tight.</seg>
<seg id="120">Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for a "lack of coordination with related institutions" despite having been granted rare permission to film.</seg>
<seg id="121">According to Phelim Kine, Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi's election campaign pledges to lift reporting restrictions to boost transparency and development have not been realized.</seg>
<seg id="122">"There are new hazards for foreign journalists attempting to report from Indonesia's restive easternmost provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa denial and blacklisting," he said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="123">The lack of press scrutiny means international pressure on the Indonesian government has been largely limited to Papua's immediate neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="124">In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, and the Solomon Islands - urged the U.N. Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.</seg>
<seg id="125">These same countries have historically backed the OPM.</seg>
<seg id="126">Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Arrmanatha Nasir shrugged off the group's allegations, telling journalists in Jakarta, "In Indonesia, a democratic system still applies and there's free media so it's hard for the evidence of human rights cases to be covered up."</seg>
<seg id="127">Local people want more foreign governments to take note.</seg>
<seg id="128">When an official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by the nation's human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, local people broke their silence, beseeching, "We want freedom," according to a source who also attended the meeting but who asked to stay anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="129">Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but Papuans say they are unlikely to vote again for Jokowi.</seg>
<seg id="130">"Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Paniai shooting," says Gobai, the tribal council chairman.</seg>
<seg id="131">He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, aside from living under the looming threat of a rapacious military, wallow in destitution, with paltry education and health services.</seg>
<seg id="132">Gobai says the Paniai people, like other Papuans, consider their vote to Jokowi as a "debt" he must repay.</seg>
<seg id="133">"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.</seg>
<seg id="134">Despite the threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai shooting victims carried out one last symbolic act of defiance: burying one victim's body on land just opposite the police and military station.</seg>
<seg id="135">Knowing that justice may never be served, at least they won't let those responsible forget their crimes.</seg>
<seg id="136">"A member of our family has been killed," says Yacobus, head bowed.</seg>
<seg id="137">"What else could we do?"</seg>

<seg id="3">It's the second blaze to sweep through the high-rise - which happens to be called the Torch tower - in just two years.</seg>
<seg id="4">The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and there was no immediate word on the cause of the blaze.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We were sleeping and we woke up to the fire alarm and people screaming.</seg>
<seg id="6">We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to reach from the 50th floor," a resident who gave his name as George told Reuters.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dubai's civil defence authorities said firefighting squads put out the blaze at around 4.00 am local time (0000 GMT) and were cooling the building.</seg>
<seg id="8">The government said it was working on providing shelter for those affected.</seg>
<seg id="9">The incident may revive questions about the safety of materials used on the exteriors of tall buildings across the world.</seg>
<seg id="10">An investigation by the management of the Torch after its 2015 fire found that most of the damage was to the cladding, exterior panelling used for decoration or insulation.</seg>

<seg id="2">The president of the International Tennis Federation has failed with his big Davis Cup coup in the general assembly.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, the (for this sport) revolutionary suggestion to from now on play the Davis Cup singles over only best-of-three sets received just shy – by a whisker – of the necessary two-thirds majority in support.</seg>
<seg id="4">The admittedly often very long, but for that reason also greatly treasured, five-set classics are therefore surviving in the traditional competition.</seg>
<seg id="5">63.54 per cent of the member countries voted in favour of the reform; ITF president David Haggerty's objective was therefore only just missed.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We respect the decision, but are disappointed that our member nations have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.</seg>
<seg id="7">We need change in order to secure the long-term future of this iconic and historic competition," said Haggerty.</seg>
<seg id="8">There will continue to be work done to improve the competition.</seg>
<seg id="9">After many objections beforehand already, the suggestion to hold the final at a neutral location did not even make it to the vote.</seg>
<seg id="10">New from 2018 are only comparatively small details: so, in future, the finalists of the David Cup and Fed Cup will have the right to host in the first round the following year.</seg>

<seg id="2">A survey of airline passengers found that more than 20 per cent had knowingly or unknowingly smuggled prohibited items past the US Transportation Security Administration checkpoints onto the aircraft, including at least 6 per cent who boarded the plane while unintentionally carrying prohibited knives or other bladed objects.</seg>
<seg id="3">Less than 1 per cent claimed that they discovered belatedly that they had mistakenly travelled with firearms, ammunition or explosives.</seg>
<seg id="4">The survey of more than 1000 people - which was conducted by a jet-chartering service Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travellers were more likely to flout the rules.</seg>
<seg id="5">Of the respondents who admitted knowingly trying to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7 per cent were millennials, compared with less than 15 per cent who were members of Generation X.</seg>
<seg id="6">The most common items whisked past TSA agents on purpose were food and liquids.</seg>
<seg id="7">More than 3 per cent admitted knowingly carrying bladed items past security, while 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents also acknowledged intentionally carrying prohibited drugs onto the aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="8">The company said it surveyed travellers around the country to find out how many had accidentally brought contraband through airport security and how many had done so on purpose.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's no surprise that the people most likely to haul contraband past security - knowingly or unknowingly - were those who fly the most.</seg>
<seg id="10">As the company points out, however, the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.</seg>
<seg id="11">People are often uncertain of what liquids they can carry or how much of them.</seg>
<seg id="12">So it's no surprise that the largest amount of stuff seized by the TSA happens to be forbidden liquids.</seg>

<seg id="1">Elon Musk doesn't care: Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel their orders</seg>
<seg id="2">Electronics-multi-talent Elon Musk likes to brag about the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3".</seg>
<seg id="3">Up until now, he has withheld the fact that a portion of these customers have already cancelled their non-binding reservations.</seg>
<seg id="4">Alongside the always triumphant figures for sales increases and the even more gigantic sales targets, with the announcement of the most recent quarterly financial statement, Tesla boss Elon Musk has for the first time had to reveal another, less glamorous number: that of the cancellations for the new mass-market Model 3.</seg>
<seg id="5">In recent months, Musk had frequently used those more than 500,000 pre-orders to talk up the new car, for which distribution is just starting.</seg>
<seg id="6">Musk now concedes that of the 518,000 total pre-orders, 63,000 have already been retracted.</seg>
<seg id="7">Critics had time and again pointed out that they were only non-binding reservations.</seg>
<seg id="8">In cases of cancellation, Tesla pays the 1000-euro (in the USA, 1000-US-dollar, and in Great Britain, 1000-pound) "reservation deposit" back in its entirety.</seg>
<seg id="9">There are currently 455,000 such non-binding reservations, conceded Musk in a conference call with analysts.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of as of yet 12 per cent of all orders could become a problem.</seg>
<seg id="11">His argument: The challenge for ambitious growth targets is not in demand but on the production side.</seg>
<seg id="12">Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="13">In 2018 – all models taken together – it is said to be 500,000, and in 2020, a million.</seg>
<seg id="14">The demand is therefore clearly there.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to Musk, a further 1800 reservations arrive each day.</seg>
<seg id="16">Anyone who orders a "Model 3" today is looking at delivery in the second half of 2018 at the earliest – that's if Tesla manages to get its brand-spanking new production lines going, as of yet never tested in practice, without any major interruptions and at maximum capacity.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many experts doubt whether that's possible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Should there be major delays, however, the non-binding nature of the reservations could become a problem for Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="19">For the company cannot then prevent unsatisfied customers from running away in droves.</seg>

<seg id="1">EPA Chief Pruitt Backtracks on Delaying Obama-Era Rules to Reduce Emissions</seg>
<seg id="2">One day after getting sued by 15 states, Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt reversed his earlier decision to delay implementation of Obama-era rules reducing emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.</seg>
<seg id="3">Pruitt presented the change as his agency being more responsive than past administrations to the needs of state environmental regulators.</seg>
<seg id="4">He made no mention of the legal challenge filed against his prior position in a federal appeals court.</seg>
<seg id="5">At issue is an Oct. 1 deadline for states to begin meeting 2015 standards for ground-level ozone.</seg>
<seg id="6">Pruitt announced in June he would delay compliance by one year to give his agency more time to study the plan and avoid "interfering with local decisions or impeding economic growth."</seg>
<seg id="7">Pruitt, who was Oklahoma's state attorney general prior to his appointment by President Donald Trump, has long served as a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations.</seg>
<seg id="8">Since arriving in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations opposed by the chemical and fossil-fuel industries.</seg>
<seg id="9">Wednesday's sudden reversal is the latest legal setback for Pruitt's regulatory rollback agenda.</seg>
<seg id="10">Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled the EPA administrator overstepped his authority in trying to delay implementation of an Obama administration rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.</seg>
<seg id="11">In a statement issued Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested his about-face on ozone standards simply reinforced the EPA's commitment to working with states through the complex process of meeting the new standards on time.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Under previous administrations, EPA would often fail to meet designation deadlines, and then wait to be sued by activist groups and others, agreeing in a settlement to set schedules for designation," said Pruitt, who sued EPA more than a dozen times in his prior job.</seg>
<seg id="13">"We do not believe in regulation through litigation, and we take deadlines seriously.</seg>
<seg id="14">We also take the statute and the authority it gives us seriously."</seg>
<seg id="15">Still, the EPA's statement said Pruitt may at some point once again use his "delay authority and all other authority legally available" to ensure regulations "are founded on sound policy and the best available information."</seg>
<seg id="16">Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader rewrite of the ozone rules.</seg>
<seg id="17">A House bill approved last month seeks to delay implementation of the 2015 rules at least eight years.</seg>
<seg id="18">The measure has not yet been brought to a vote in the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="19">New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group intends to keep up the legal pressure.</seg>
<seg id="20">"The EPA's reversal - following our lawsuits - is an important win for the health and safety of those 6.7 million New Yorkers, and the over 115 million Americans directly impacted by smog pouring into their communities," Schneiderman said.</seg>
<seg id="21">New York was joined in the case by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, and the District of Columbia.</seg>
<seg id="22">Ground-level ozone is created when common pollutants emitted by cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere to sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="23">The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems among sensitive groups of people, contributing to thousands of premature deaths each year.</seg>
<seg id="24">Public health advocates and environmentalists cheered Pruitt's surprising change of course.</seg>
<seg id="25">"It's disturbing how much pressure it took to get this commonsense step from the guy in charge of protecting the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.</seg>
<seg id="26">"We've got to keep fighting the Trump administration's ideological crusade to pander to polluters and special interests."</seg>

<seg id="1">Tumlingen is celebrating 750 years of the St. Hilarius Church</seg>
<seg id="2">750 years of the St. Hilarius Church: To mark the anniversary of the mountain church, invitations are being issued to a serenade in the old cemetery grounds in Tumlingen on Sunday 16th July at 4.30pm.</seg>
<seg id="3">Due to its idyllic setting and beautiful view over the village, the historical site of St. Hilarius is a beloved place to tarry a while.</seg>
<seg id="4">Visitors to the sixth benefit serenade can let themselves be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Friends and Supporters of Tumlingen have made the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the area their concern.</seg>
<seg id="6">Walter Martini stresses: "It is a one-of-a-kind rural jewel".</seg>
<seg id="7">The St. Hilarius chapel was first mentioned in records in 1267 in the Württemberg register: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church for Tumlingen on it, together with the Bailiwick" to Master Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 silver marks.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the text of the official document, aside from the former parish church, a lordly farm also stood on the Tumlingen mountain, which itself owned the church, or the right of patronage, and not the other way around.</seg>
<seg id="9">People therefore also lived there too.</seg>
<seg id="10">As is apparent from the upper administrative office for Freudenstadt's description in 1858, the "mountain" was, alongside the lower village and the upper village that can just about be made out still in the appearance of Tumlingen today, the village's third, grand centre of settlement.</seg>
<seg id="11">All maps from the time of around 1600 substantiate this historical reality.</seg>
<seg id="12">The right of patronage arose out of the Early Middle-Age proprietary church law.</seg>
<seg id="13">A lord who built and furnished a church and staffed it with a priest still remained the owner of this church and was also able to bequeath this proprietary church right.</seg>
<seg id="14">Associated with this was the right to appoint a priest or nominate a new priest to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="15">There were three altars in the church and two bells in the tower.</seg>
<seg id="16">The larger of the two shattered at Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="17">The newly acquired bell then first chimed in 1692, but had to later be surrendered in the Second World War, in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="18">During the 30 Years War (1616 to 1648) the window panes were smashed in and the bell ropes stolen.</seg>
<seg id="19">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="20">In 1796, French troops made camp in the vicinity of the church.</seg>
<seg id="21">They brought out the pulpit and the pews and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="22">The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="23">Up until 1869, the Hilarius cemetery in Tumlingen served as the last place of rest for Hörschweiler's dead.</seg>
<seg id="24">In 1823, the cemetery was expanded and the Hilarius church was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="25">Only the church tower was left standing.</seg>
<seg id="26">On new year's eve of 1834, a storm cleaved the church tower and half of it collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="27">In order to prevent an accident, the tower was pulled down.</seg>
<seg id="28">Only the dwarf tower that is still present today survived as witness of the church's 750-year-old history.</seg>
<seg id="29">Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem from the "Industrious Pensioners" care for the Hilarius site, as successors of Dieter Dockhorn.</seg>
<seg id="30">As event organiser, the Friends and Supporters of Tumlingen are issuing invitations to the sixth serenade in the old cemetery to St. Hilarius Chapel, on Sunday 16th July.</seg>
<seg id="31">It is being arranged by the Kepler Gymnasium, Freudenstadt, combo, with speeches from Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="32">Municipal administrator Hartmut Romann gave the closing words.</seg>
<seg id="33">The programme starts at 4.30pm.</seg>
<seg id="34">Last admission is at 3.30pm.</seg>
<seg id="35">The serenade will be rounded off with drinks in front of the cemetery.</seg>
<seg id="36">"Enjoy a summer's evening under the shadows of old trees and with a wide view over the meadows right up to forest," invite the organisers, emphasising the fantastic view.</seg>
<seg id="37">The serenade will only take place in the case of dry weather.</seg>
<seg id="38">The organisers are hoping for many backers in favour of preserving the historic St. Hilarius site, which is important to Tumlingen and to Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Friends and Supporters of Tumlingen feel especially bound to take care of their local region, as serenade organiser Walter Martini reinforced.</seg>

<seg id="1">Association wants to have wind turbine approval examined</seg>
<seg id="2">"Boisheim wehrt sich", sees no legal basis for the construction and has therefore turned to the District Administrator.</seg>
<seg id="3">The association "Boisheim wehrt sich" has called on District Administrator Andreas Coenen (CDU) to retract his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in Boisheimer Nette.</seg>
<seg id="4">They say it was unlawful.</seg>
<seg id="5">The association argues that at the time the approval was given on 30th December 2016, no wind turbines could have been approved in Bosheimer Nette, since at that time only one wind energy concentration zone existed in Viersen, on the city boundary with Schwalmtal.</seg>
<seg id="6">Construction and operation of wind energy plants are in principle possible within this concentration zone, but at the same time, the concentration zone has an exclusion against the use of wind energy for the rest of the city area.</seg>
<seg id="7">Such zones are said to prevent "asparagusisation" of the landscape.</seg>
<seg id="8">The city of Viersen had in fact passed a resolution for a second wind energy concentration zone in Boisheimer Nette a few days earlier, through an amendment to the local land-use plan – but the Düsseldorf regional government had not approved it due to a formal error.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Due to the lack of legal planning requirements, the approval decision that was issued is still unlawful, and should therefore be retracted as well," said Christoph Erkens, chairman of "Boisheim wehrt sich".</seg>
<seg id="10">The current state of affairs: the city council once again passed a resolution for the wind concentration zone in Boisheimer Nette before the summer break; approval from the regional government is still pending.</seg>
<seg id="11">Erkens: "Grant of approval for the construction of wind turbines on this site is therefore precluded by planning law."</seg>
<seg id="12">The district confirms receipt of the call for action.</seg>
<seg id="13">"The relevant correspondence was received by the district of Viersen in the last week," declared a spokesperson.</seg>
<seg id="14">The district is taking it as a reason to investigate the matter afresh.</seg>
<seg id="15">However, it is not expected to lead to a stop in proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="16">With a view to the proceedings underway at the administrative court, the district did not want to comment on Thursday on the content of the arguments put forward by the association "Boisheim wehrt sich".</seg>
<seg id="17">NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, is planning construction of four wind turbines, each 200 metres high, on a plot by Bosheimer Nette.</seg>
<seg id="18">The company, in which the city of Viersen holds indirect participating interests, had concluded lease agreements with the owner of the roughly 65-hectare site last year already.</seg>
<seg id="19">The construction of the four wind turbines should cover the energy requirements of around 11,400 households – that equates to around a fifth of the energy requirements of all Viersen households.</seg>
<seg id="20">NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="21">Last summer, Viersen city council gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Linnich wind park near Aachen, as well as a share in a wind energy plant in Übachpalenberg in the district of Heinsberg.</seg>

<seg id="1">Town and dealers plan "hometown shopping" weekend</seg>
<seg id="2">Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are to newly discover the shopping opportunities in their town centre in September.</seg>
<seg id="3">The trade association and town authorities want to use the weekend of the 8th and 9th September to entice residents to a shopping spree in the town centre.</seg>
<seg id="4">As chairman of the trade association Christian König announced, the "home-town shopping" weekend is meant to make customers aware of what offers their own town has available aside from the usual supermarket goods.</seg>
<seg id="5">A market with local suppliers is thus planned, similar to the weekly market.</seg>
<seg id="6">In addition, homegrown companies are to give showcases, with their apprenticeship places.</seg>
<seg id="7">Furthermore, the businesses in the town centre are to invite people to come "midnight shopping".</seg>
<seg id="8">The campaign is not only for residents of the town and the nearby region.</seg>
<seg id="9">Adverts on the radio, an online video and printed bags that allude to the campaign weekend are in preparation, Christian König tells us.</seg>
<seg id="10">Town authorities and the trade association are cooperating with the Chamber of Industry and Commerce.</seg>
<seg id="11">The trade association and the town are thus entering a further stage of the "attractive town centre" project.</seg>
<seg id="12">To this belong new offerings such as the first "active day" for the fountain festival along with Sunday trading, talks with all the traders and proprietors to induce people to actively participate.</seg>
<seg id="13">Attractive offers on the Saturday and waiving of parking fees on this day are also part of the concept.</seg>
<seg id="14">In addition, new and existing customer bases can be developed.</seg>
<seg id="15">This includes spa guests and tourists.</seg>
<seg id="16">But many locals too had lost sight of the town centre for shopping.</seg>
<seg id="17">Ultimately, it all has to contribute to breathing life into the town centre – right up to landlords, businesses across the whole town and associations.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have to overcome the lethargy with a network that has partly built up, König had said in the spring.</seg>
<seg id="19">Brigit Streich, head of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce centre in Mühlhausen communicated that five Thüringen towns are taking part in the nation's third "hometown shopping" day.</seg>
<seg id="20">Alongside Bad Lagensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.</seg>
<seg id="21">The day is intended to "promote appreciation for local trade and emphasise more strongly its importance for the common good of our towns," said Streich.</seg>
<seg id="22">The campaign, under the leadership of the Chamber for Industry and Commerce and with many partners, also brings home that all citizens can themselves influence their immediate environment with their shopping behaviour.</seg>

<seg id="1">Moore's Ford Massacre: Activists Reenact Racist Lynching as a Call for Justice</seg>
<seg id="2">A 1948 Ford Mercury passed through a group of onlookers in rural Monroe, Georgia, and rumbled toward the small Moore's Ford Bridge.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns stepped forward to block its path.</seg>
<seg id="4">The leader of the mob - a middle aged man in a pinstriped suit - took a long drag on his cigar and peered through the windshield.</seg>
<seg id="5">Inside, the occupants reeled in fear.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We want that n----r Roger!" the man barked.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Get him out of the car!"</seg>
<seg id="8">Screams ripped through the silence as a young black man was dragged from the front passenger seat.</seg>
<seg id="9">Fortunately, this horrific scene, which played out on July 22, is just a reenactment.</seg>
<seg id="10">But when a noose is thrown around the neck of "Roger," nearly everyone in the audience let out very real gasps.</seg>
<seg id="11">Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to the Moore's Ford Bridge to recreate the night two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom, and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.</seg>
<seg id="12">No one has ever been charged with the murders.</seg>
<seg id="13">"It's mind boggling that all of these years, not a single person has been arrested - even though we see them in our communities; even though we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps organize the reenactment.</seg>
<seg id="14">"It's a stain on a history, but it's a burden on our souls."</seg>
<seg id="15">Brooks is a 71-year-old former Georgia state congressman and lifelong civil rights activist.</seg>
<seg id="16">For him, the reenactment serves as a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We want prosecution, we want closure, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but we have to have justice first," he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We can't get to healing and reconciliation until we get justice."</seg>
<seg id="19">A coroner places a sheet over the body of one of the victims of the Moore's Ford lynching on July 27, 1946.</seg>
<seg id="20">According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching.</seg>
<seg id="21">But not one was ever prosecuted.</seg>
<seg id="22">Though the suspects have remained at large for decades, civil rights activists say the twin motivations for the lynchings were always well known throughout town: politics and sex.</seg>
<seg id="23">In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling enabled black citizens in Georgia to cast ballots for the first time during the primary race later that summer.</seg>
<seg id="24">Around the same time of the election, according to the FBI, black sharecropper Roger Malcom stabbed Barnett Hester, a white landowner, during a fight - ostensibly over a woman.</seg>
<seg id="25">Brooks said the town rumor was that Hester had been sleeping with Malcom's wife, Dorothy, and that the baby she was carrying was not her husband's.</seg>
<seg id="26">On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to bail Malcom out of jail, according to the FBI.</seg>
<seg id="27">He was accompanied to the prison by Dorothy, and their cousins, Mae Murray and George Dorsey.</seg>
<seg id="28">But, driving away from the jail, as they approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a lynch mob surrounded the car.</seg>
<seg id="29">"As it turns out it was Harrison who set up and ordered the murders," one FBI report concludes.</seg>
<seg id="30">"It is also apparent that there was a conspiracy among state and local law enforcement, who not only took part in the murders, disposed of evidence and concealed the identity of witnesses."</seg>
<seg id="31">Brooks put it more succinctly.</seg>
<seg id="32">"It was a voting rights massacre," he said.</seg>
<seg id="33">"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: 'If you register and if you vote, this is what will happen to you.'"</seg>
<seg id="34">For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has directed the annual reenactment of the Moore's Ford Bridge lynchings.</seg>
<seg id="35">Her performance is graphic, gripping and grounded in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America.</seg>
<seg id="36">It's difficult to watch, and even more difficult to look away, but Greene said that's the point.</seg>
<seg id="37">"We don't want to talk about the lynching because it makes us face the ugliness in all of us," she said.</seg>
<seg id="38">"But I can't build a relationship with you, if you won't hear me, or hear what I've been through."</seg>
<seg id="39">Rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - crowded into a room and listened as Greene launched into a well-rehearsed overview of the play.</seg>
<seg id="40">Wade Marbaugh serves as Greene's co-director.</seg>
<seg id="41">He's played the part of the head Klansman for years, but he said the role never gets any easier.</seg>
<seg id="42">"I feel dirty because this is not who I am," said Marbaugh.</seg>
<seg id="43">"But I think it's very important to keep this history alive because we don't want to go back to those times."</seg>
<seg id="44">Across the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, rehearsed their lines.</seg>
<seg id="45">The play begins with Malcom shouting and shoving Hester, livid that he's been sleeping with his wife, Dorothy.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I said n---a, get off my property!"</seg>
<seg id="47">Rascona fires back.</seg>
<seg id="48">There's a beat.</seg>
<seg id="49">And then everyone (at least all the black actors) bursts into laughter.</seg>
<seg id="50">Greene laughs the hardest.</seg>
<seg id="51">"What?!," Rascona asked.</seg>
<seg id="52">He's alarmed, confused.</seg>
<seg id="53">Did I go too hard?</seg>
<seg id="54">"No," Greene said through chuckles.</seg>
<seg id="55">"I just don't think white people back then said 'n---a.'"</seg>
<seg id="56">"Yea," one of the other black cast members quipped.</seg>
<seg id="57">"You have to hit the hard 'R.'"</seg>
<seg id="58">And just like that the energy in the room shifts; a sense of camaraderie replaces the discomfort.</seg>
<seg id="59">Everyone is dedicated to getting this right, not only for the sake of the play, but also for the memory of the four people killed.</seg>
<seg id="60">The scene begins again.</seg>
<seg id="61">This time, when Rascona says the N-word, it's sharp and emphatic.</seg>
<seg id="62">Absolutely no one laughs.</seg>
<seg id="63">The reenactment ends violently and quickly.</seg>
<seg id="64">There's screams, gunfire and then, silence.</seg>
<seg id="65">A woman dressed in funeral black, stands over the actors bodies and performs Billie Holiday's mournful eulogy, "Strange Fruit."</seg>
<seg id="66">Her voice breaks on every other word.</seg>
<seg id="67">A hundred yards back, a group of about four dozen spectators wipe sweat and tears away from their eyes.</seg>
<seg id="68">The audience is almost evenly split between black and white.</seg>
<seg id="69">One couple has traveled from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many are from just down the road.</seg>
<seg id="70">They've all weathered Georgia's oppressive humidity for the nearly eight hours as Brooks lead them on a pilgrimage to the grave sites of the Malcoms and Dorseys.</seg>
<seg id="71">Up until this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, standing on the same land where the lynchings took place, the air feels haunted.</seg>
<seg id="72">As the final notes of the song fade, Greene invites the crowd to move closer and inspect the bodies.</seg>
<seg id="73">Children crouch by their heads, take in the fake blood and still bodies, and whisper to each other.</seg>
<seg id="74">"They're not really dead," one little boy mutters, as if to remind himself.</seg>
<seg id="75">After a few minutes Greene thanks the crowd, and suddenly it's over.</seg>
<seg id="76">The actors throw off the lynching rope and wipe away tears.</seg>
<seg id="77">Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the head Klansman.</seg>
<seg id="78">Nick Rascona hugs two of his castmates, and then breaks down crying in their arms; the emotional toll of the performance finally getting to him.</seg>
<seg id="79">"It's okay," one of the women whispers.</seg>
<seg id="80">"We know that's not what's in your heart.</seg>
<seg id="81">You did this for a reason."</seg>
<seg id="82">Later, the audience sits down to dinner with the actors.</seg>
<seg id="83">At one table, a white couple from Atlanta chats animatedly about the reenactment with a black couple they just met.</seg>
<seg id="84">Denise Duplinski struggled to find words for how the performance made her feel.</seg>
<seg id="85">"It's hard to hear those horrible awful words, and deeds ... come out of people that look like you and who do it because they look like you," she said.</seg>
<seg id="86">"What this really does to me is make me think that lynchings are still going on," she added, "they're just called police shootings now."</seg>
<seg id="87">Across the room, Tyrone Brooks holds court at his table, eating and reminiscing about civil rights.</seg>
<seg id="88">He said he's already begun planning for next year's performance.</seg>
<seg id="89">"The reenactment is inspirational in a way because it describes the horror of what we endured, but it also is a teaching moment," he said.</seg>
<seg id="90">"It's like, if you don't learn from this, it can happen again.</seg>
<seg id="91">Those who don't study their history, those who do not know their history, are doomed to repeat it."</seg>

<seg id="4">In front is parked an open vintage Mercedes car, in which the Rhinemaidens pose like rocker girls, or alternatively, an Isetta.</seg>
<seg id="5">Stacked oil barrels are reminiscent of Castorf's leitmotif – gold, power and greed – that runs through his production of the "Ring".</seg>
<seg id="6">The three Rhinemaidens – sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner – work wonderfully together, as they did already in "Rheingold".</seg>
<seg id="7">They saucily seduce Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), lug a body in the boot in Hollywood manner, and play the riotous clique.</seg>
<seg id="8">Stephen Milling sings the part of the superbly nasty Hagen, who has the aura of a heavy-weight boxer.</seg>
<seg id="9">The scene where he slays Siegfried is brutal.</seg>
<seg id="10">Later, Gunther (Markus Eiche) cops it too.</seg>
<seg id="11">The audience thanks the ensemble with mighty applause.</seg>
<seg id="12">There is a rapturous reception for Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski, who effaces himself and bows his hands, forming a Merkel diamond.</seg>
<seg id="13">There is huge applause for the Festival Orchestra, who appear on stage for the first time – in casual leisurewear in view of the high heat.</seg>
<seg id="14">The performance from Frank Castorf and his directing team had been awaited with excitement.</seg>
<seg id="15">Even if in 2013 he had had to endure another hall full of shrill catcalls, five years later there were great cheers, which drowned out the isolated boos.</seg>
<seg id="16">Festival head Katharina Wagner will likely have been delighted.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Once can see that the audience has in some way grown into the "Ring"," she had said shortly before the performance from the dpa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The audience has not only made a kind of peace with Castorf, but on top of that, an understanding for his point of view has grown.</seg>
<seg id="19">I see positive results.</seg>

<seg id="1">Max Menge works as volunteer</seg>
<seg id="2">During your voluntary service year, you're working at many locations simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="3">What are all the different places?</seg>
<seg id="4">Menge: Normally in Steinfurt in the furniture exchange, and once a week I help out here in Greven in the Möbelbrücke.</seg>
<seg id="5">And I have also worked at the full-day school in their supplementary activities.</seg>
<seg id="6">What are your experiences of that?</seg>
<seg id="7">Menge: It is a nice, broad spectrum that I see here.</seg>
<seg id="8">I deal with different people: with adolescents, with refugees, with young adults.</seg>
<seg id="9">You are 26 years old now, so a volunteer with a late-calling.</seg>
<seg id="10">How did that come about?</seg>
<seg id="11">Menge: I did my Abitur exams.</seg>
<seg id="12">And then I successfully abandoned, shall we say, a civil engineering course of studies.</seg>
<seg id="13">I recognised that it is not right for me and that I want to do something else, work with people.</seg>
<seg id="14">And then I asked myself, what do you do?</seg>
<seg id="15">Do a social year, you can get an insight, can see what it is really like on site, in the thick of things too perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="16">And was it like that?</seg>
<seg id="17">Menge: I gathered great insights.</seg>
<seg id="18">I will start my studies in social affairs in the winter semester.</seg>
<seg id="19">I will study in dual, probably do an apprenticeship as a welfare worker at the Herne child protective services and study in Hamm at the university of applied sciences.</seg>
<seg id="20">Is it not somewhat unusual to have several different work locations during the voluntary service?</seg>
<seg id="21">Menge: Yes, it is very variable.</seg>
<seg id="22">It always depends on where one is doing their voluntary service year.</seg>
<seg id="23">One can do it from at the old people's home right up to in youth work – in all possible facets of social work.</seg>
<seg id="24">In my case, it was very varied.</seg>
<seg id="25">I was also sometimes at the open full-day schools, that is, for the afternoon care.</seg>
<seg id="26">For me that was exactly the right thing, the thing that got me fired up.</seg>
<seg id="27">I was able to recognise and see my own strengths, as it was really happening.</seg>
<seg id="28">Differently from when doing the civil engineering studies?</seg>
<seg id="29">Menge: Yeah, sure; here it's not about working out statistics.</seg>
<seg id="30">One always has other people at the front of their minds, people who all have totally different histories behind them.</seg>
<seg id="31">Whether it's a refugee or an adolescent who has been pulled out of their family – you always have to approach it individually.</seg>
<seg id="32">Very interesting.</seg>
<seg id="33">And they didn't have any fear of contact?</seg>
<seg id="34">Menge: I'm not the kind of guy for that.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is an area that gives one a lot.</seg>
<seg id="36">A lot of love, a lot of friendliness.</seg>
<seg id="37">There are negative moments too sometimes, but that's just life.</seg>

<seg id="2">A suicide bomber has attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killing a Nato soldier and wounding several others, officials say.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, a Nato statement said.</seg>
<seg id="4">Unconfirmed local reports say three civilians also died in the incident in the city's Qarabagh district.</seg>
<seg id="5">The bombing is the latest violence to have hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque blast in Herat.</seg>
<seg id="6">On Monday a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.</seg>
<seg id="7">A Nato statement said that Thursday evening's blast happened when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "personnel-borne improvised explosive device."</seg>
<seg id="8">The statement said that all those injured are in a stable condition and are being treated at the US military hospital at Bagram airfield.</seg>
<seg id="9">Correspondents say the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major source of concern to Nato forces based in nearby Bagram.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to the United Nations, Afghanistan saw at least 1,662 civilian deaths in the first half of 2017, with about 20% of those in the capital.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the end of July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shia district of Kabul.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Taliban said they had carried out that attack.</seg>
<seg id="13">On 31 May, a huge bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people, the deadliest militant attack in the country since US-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="14">The violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan as US President Donald Trump weighs up whether to increase the number of US troops aiding the military and police in the country.</seg>
<seg id="15">Correspondents say the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and in particular the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.</seg>

<seg id="2">The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reversed a decision to delay an Obama-era rule requiring states to curb smog-causing emissions, one day after 15 states sued the agency over the move.</seg>
<seg id="3">The EPA announced the decision to go ahead with the so-called "2015 Ozone Designations" late on Wednesday, saying it showed the agency's commitment to working with states.</seg>
<seg id="4">"We believe in dialogue with, and being responsive to, our state partners," EPA Chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="5">Pruitt in June had announced the EPA's intention to delay the ozone designations - in which existing smog pollution is measured in parts of the country to determine where cuts must be made to meet tougher air quality standard - by one year to October 2018.</seg>
<seg id="6">A group of 15 mostly Democratic states, along with the District of Columbia, filed a suit on Tuesday saying the effort was illegal.</seg>
<seg id="7">The administration of President Donald Trump has been seeking to roll back a wide array of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama, as part of a broader agenda Trump says is aimed at sparking economic growth.</seg>
<seg id="8">But the efforts have triggered pushback by Democratics and conservation groups who are concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health.</seg>

<seg id="1">Municipal council wants common room</seg>
<seg id="2">In the end, the decision was clear: with two dissenting votes, the municipal council of Fluorn-Winzeln passed a resolution for a common room in the future retirement home.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ahead of the debate, there is an important piece of information to be had: the purchase contract for the as yet still needed plot section has been signed, reports mayor Bernhard Tjaden.</seg>
<seg id="4">Admittedly it will still be a while until the plot, which up until now has belonged to the church parish, comes into the possession of the municipality, but nevertheless, there are now no longer any planning obstacles for the project that has to be materialised by a private investor.</seg>
<seg id="5">That is why there is a debate concerning a common room.</seg>
<seg id="6">One of the two investors that are still on board has offered to accommodate the municipality.</seg>
<seg id="7">For a special price, it would provide a living space – of around 55 square metres – and an adjacent terrace with no less than 70 square metres on the ground floor.</seg>
<seg id="8">What the management and the majority of the municipal council have in mind is not simply to set aside such a common room as a meeting place only for the residents of the senior citizens' accommodation, but for it to be open to the community.</seg>
<seg id="9">Talk of a "knitting café" was making the rounds, for example.</seg>
<seg id="10">The decision, which was already pre-determined last Autumn through the allocation of resources for the current budget, is sweetened by funding opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="11">The building is in an area for redevelopment.</seg>
<seg id="12">The construction of a common room would be eligible for financial support, reports Tjaden, with 60 per cent of 30 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="13">So as to signal to the investor that no-one wants to put a spoke in their wheel, the proposed resolution makes allowances for the determination that both a saddled roof – based on the surrounding buildings – and a mono-pitch roof – which reduces the height of the eaves and makes the building more economical – would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="14">An uneccessary addition, thinks not only Wilfried Sohmer.</seg>
<seg id="15">If it helps: it passes through the committee unanimously.</seg>
<seg id="16">It's not so easy with the common room.</seg>
<seg id="17">Daniela Ruf points to their many owned buildings that are not really being forged ahead, but instead they are going out of their way with the common room: "I have difficulty with that," she says.</seg>
<seg id="18">Yvonne Staiger declares herself to be unequivocally in favour of the common room – but absolutely against an investment from the municipality.</seg>
<seg id="19">She views that as a hidden subsidy to already wealthy, or even foreign, investors.</seg>
<seg id="20">That is simply not true according to the counterargument, for by purchasing the plot they are not giving away any grants, but are rather getting a genuine, when in doubt saleable, equivalent in value.</seg>
<seg id="21">Staiger's proposal, to split up the proposed resolution accordingly, has three supporters.</seg>
<seg id="22">So, with two dissenting votes, they are sticking with the original programme, which Stefan Haller summed up as follows: "If we pass the resolution as so, we make a huge step towards plugging a huge gap in our infrastructure."</seg>

<seg id="1">Wandering from star to star in the Harz</seg>
<seg id="2">The nation's first "astral path" is to come to life in the Harz.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is being planned by the Sankt Andreasberg Observatory society.</seg>
<seg id="4">There has been a planetary trail in Göttingen since 2003.</seg>
<seg id="5">An "astral path" satisfies many Harz visitors' need for information, it is said.</seg>
<seg id="6">It combines nature, science, exercise and athletic performance.</seg>
<seg id="7">Members want to set up plaques along the planned route and put information about stars and constellations on them.</seg>
<seg id="8">In a first phase, until 2018, the association is planning "easily accessible installations in five to six locations" in the Upper Harz.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the running are St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiss and Sieber.</seg>
<seg id="10">The information on the plaques is to be expanded upon online.</seg>
<seg id="11">So good mobile network reception plays a part in the selection of locations.</seg>
<seg id="12">Accessibility is also a criterion.</seg>
<seg id="13">The astral path is later to be extended, step by step.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Spectators will gain lots of useful knowledge on the astral path, for example about the physics of the individual stars," explained the society.</seg>
<seg id="15">In addition, they will learn why stars have different colours, or why one star shines more brightly than another, although it is significantly further away.</seg>
<seg id="16">It will also teach which constellation a selected star is located in, and when the best time to see it is.</seg>
<seg id="17">The society has been operating the highest observatory in Northern Germany, in the small mountain town of St. Andreasberg, since 2014 already.</seg>
<seg id="18">The location in the middle of the Harz national park is among the six darkest regions in Germany, according to information from the Federal Agency for Nature Conservation.</seg>
<seg id="19">One can regularly clearly see the Milky Way, and even the Andromeda Galaxy, from there with naked eyes.</seg>
<seg id="20">The university town, on the initiative of the Göttingen Planetarium friends' association, has had something similar to the astral path since 2013 – the planetary trail.</seg>
<seg id="21">Starting at Gebhards Hotel in Goethealle, which forms the centre of our solar system, the planetary trail leads with its steles up to Hainberg and the observatory – as well as an "extra-terrestrial" location in Diemarden (Municipality of Gleichen) with the planet Sedna.</seg>
<seg id="22">The steles with the individual planets – including Pluto, which was downgraded to a dwarf planet, at the end point – are set up at exact intervals and on a scale of one to two billion.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Earth thus shrinks to a ball with a diameter of 6.5 millimetres, while the sun, standing exactly 75 metres away, measures 70 centimetres.</seg>
<seg id="24">The total distance covered by the planetary trail is a good four kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="25">While the light of the sun needs around eight hours to reach Pluto, pedestrians need a good hour to get to the stele with Pluto.</seg>
<seg id="26">So, pedestrians are faster than light in space.</seg>
<seg id="27">The trek to the nearest fixed star would take another half a year though.</seg>

<seg id="2">Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course to stage the most compelling boxing match under 147 pounds in the near future, met each other for the first time Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">They were in separate rooms at ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the unbeaten World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked down the hallway to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization super-featherweight champion.</seg>
<seg id="4">After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision over former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both fighters are members of the top-five pound-for-pound list.</seg>
<seg id="5">Garcia extended his right hand and said, "How you doing, champ?</seg>
<seg id="6">Best of luck to you."</seg>
<seg id="7">Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 7 on ESPN.</seg>
<seg id="8">As the pair posed for photos, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noted that a potential showdown between the fighters would be "perfect sizing."</seg>
<seg id="9">"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia reminded.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I moved up for Broner [at 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.</seg>
<seg id="11">I'm small for 140.</seg>
<seg id="12">I want to come down to lightweight.</seg>
<seg id="13">And he's got to move up to lightweight [135 pounds] and then we have a fight.</seg>
<seg id="14">That's what the fans are asking for.</seg>
<seg id="15">Let's give them that."</seg>
<seg id="16">Lomachenko agreed.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Boxing needs this fight."</seg>
<seg id="18">Klimas asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy he has to have Lomachenko fight a 135-pound debut bout later this year to set up a date next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who also has interest in fighting the Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell winner following their Sept. 23 lightweight title bout at the Forum.</seg>
<seg id="19">"This fight could be on pay-per-view because all the fans have been asking about it," Garcia said, later expressing openness to fighting on whatever network offers the best financial package.</seg>
<seg id="20">"We're the main names.</seg>
<seg id="21">No other names can generate that kind of attention.</seg>
<seg id="22">Whenever they're ready ... ."</seg>
<seg id="23">Garcia said he appreciates Lomachenko as "a tremendous fighter," and may attend his Saturday bout.</seg>
<seg id="24">But Lomachenko paused at lavish praise for Garcia, saying he thought the three-division champion from Riverside looked "very slow, sorry Mikey ... you wanted the knockout."</seg>
<seg id="25">Garcia said the focus was to show punching strength, then box.</seg>
<seg id="26">They both said they can feel the momentum building for their own bout.</seg>
<seg id="27">"This is the fight to be made.</seg>
<seg id="28">No other fight creates as much attention and buzz.</seg>
<seg id="29">I'm more than happy to work at it," Garcia said.</seg>
<seg id="30">Said Lomachenko: "I've waited for the top fighters, and this is Mikey.</seg>
<seg id="31">It will be a great fight."</seg>

<seg id="2">Andre Hoffmann hopes after the 2:2 to kick off the season against Braunschweig that the optimisation of the defence formation will bring points in Aue.</seg>
<seg id="3">Andre Hoffmann was content with the first game of the season, and with the result too, were it not for the two own goals in the 2:2 against Braunschweig.</seg>
<seg id="4">"That was two own goals too many, and in Aue, we have to take better care still," says the defender from Fortuna Düsseldorf.</seg>
<seg id="5">The line of three at the back is to be optimised even further in the Ore mountains.</seg>
<seg id="6">And the Fortunas don't want to let in any more goals after free kicks either.</seg>
<seg id="7">"In future, no-one will stand on the line next to Michael (Rensing) any more."</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoffmann is convinced that his team manages better with the three-at-the-back formation, even after the experiences in the build-up.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I don't know yet how we will play in Aue," said the coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoachmann is sure of himself, "because in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann, we particularly have players in the back three in the half positions that can build well," said Hoffmann.</seg>
<seg id="10">"However, a prerequisite is that we harmonise even better together and don't commit so many passing errors in the build up."</seg>
<seg id="11">Naturally, Hoffmann is also travelling to Aue to win the game.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Whether after one draw though one can talk of a failed start, I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="13">The performance could by all means be okay," said Hoffmann.</seg>
<seg id="14">"However, if we're standing there on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the cup, we'll certainly be able to talk of a decent season kick-off."</seg>
<seg id="15">His coach didn't want to hear any of that.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I will first judge our start to the season after six to eight matches," said Friedhelm Funkel, who did not wish to talk of an advantage over Aue just because the Saxony team's game in Heidenhelm had to be cut-off early due to a storm.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Now they are effectively able to start the season with a home game," said Funkel, and Hoffman believes that the players from Aue could perhaps even be somewhat fresher, since they don't have any difficult and full games like Fortuna against one of the promotion favourites resting in their bones.</seg>
<seg id="18">"But they don't know 100 per cent where they stand at the moment," says the Fortuna central defender.</seg>
<seg id="19">Admittedly, the guests from the Rhineland go into the encounter on Sunday in the finally (almost) finished Aue stadium as slight favourites.</seg>
<seg id="20">"That we are going to sweep them away just because we can claim a place amongst the top six is ridiculous," says Funkel, whose balance sheet against Aue, with only one defeat in nine games, is thoroughly positive.</seg>
<seg id="21">"There is no team in the second Bundesliga that one has to beat from the outset," explains Fortuna's head coach.</seg>
<seg id="22">"To give such a statement would be arrogant and presumptuous."</seg>
<seg id="23">And Funkel does not under any circumstances want to see his players like that on Sunday.</seg>

<seg id="6">Eighty percent (2002) were judged to be 18 or over, while in a further 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the subject was "possibly 18 or over."</seg>
<seg id="7">In 432 cases the conclusion was that the person is "possibly under 18."</seg>
<seg id="8">The tests are only carried out in cases where the person's age is in question.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to Johan Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are consistent with previous months.</seg>
<seg id="10">"We see no big difference in the statistics from previous months, the numbers are quite consistent," he told The Local.</seg>
<seg id="11">The high proportion of cases judged to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied about their age.</seg>
<seg id="12">In May, the agency released the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 instances that "suggest the person examined is 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="13">When newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated the 581 results released however it found that in 243 of the cases the person had openly stated that they turn 18 this year.</seg>
<seg id="14">The method of medical age assessment, which consists of taking X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints, then having dentists and radiologists analyse them, has also been criticised in some quarters.</seg>
<seg id="15">One sceptic is Karolinska Institute endocrinologist Claude Marcus, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of people to see if they went through puberty earlier or later than usual.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I've had reason to think about this, and I don't think the type of measurement being used should be.</seg>
<seg id="17">Judging biological age in this way is very uncertain.</seg>
<seg id="18">If we can't say it for sure we shouldn't pretend that we can," he told newspaper Metro.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Forensic Medicine Agency's Göransson defended the accuracy of the tests however: "In general you can say that the risk of inaccurately judging a child to be an adult is small.</seg>
<seg id="20">The biggest risk is if the person is just under 18, in which case it's around 10 percent."</seg>

<seg id="1">Right on target</seg>
<seg id="2">The works on the three bridges of the L 108 road, between Lauterbach and Schramberg, are progressing well.</seg>
<seg id="3">On Wednesday, a seven-tonne piece of concrete was installed at the bridge at the East entrance to the town of Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="4">"We're doing very well for time – it's going great," says Reinhold Leicht, site manager at the department of road engineering and transport in the Freiburg local government.</seg>
<seg id="5">In April, works began on all three bridges in need of refurbishment between Schramberg and Lauterbach at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="6">The works are scheduled to be completed in October, and Leicht is certain that the timetable will be stuck to.</seg>
<seg id="7">The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is a vaulted arch bridge made of concrete that is covered in red variegated sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 metres.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was built in 1900.</seg>
<seg id="10">Like the other two bridges, it is old by now.</seg>
<seg id="11">In order to ensure their stability and road safety, the three structures now have to be thoroughly renovated.</seg>
<seg id="12">The two other bridges lead over the Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="13">They are made of variegated sandstone.</seg>
<seg id="14">Both were erected in 1939 and they are twelve and 10.60 metres high, respectively.</seg>
<seg id="15">The bridge at the East entrance to the town of Lauterbach has now – as of Wednesday morning – been given a 1.30-metre-wide and seven-tonne-heavy so-called bridge parapet on its north side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This fixes the boundary and is also used as a passenger path.</seg>
<seg id="17">A 2.20-metre-wide bridge parapet is to be put in place on the south part of the bridge on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="18">The pedestrian walkway is intended to then to run over that.</seg>
<seg id="19">What is special about this is that is uses finished parts, a patent of the Schramberg company Dizwo.</seg>
<seg id="20">The other two bridges are already kitted out with the patented bridge parapets.</seg>
<seg id="21">Laying cables through the structure in Lauterbach required particular flair.</seg>
<seg id="22">For a fibreglass cable also runs there, which many companies are connected to.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the run-up to the works, residents were informed about the project via a leaflet.</seg>
<seg id="24">Fish and crabs must also be fished out first.</seg>
<seg id="25">For the bridges between the construction yard building and the lake reservoir in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is single-lane and regulated by lights.</seg>
<seg id="26">For the construction works on the bridge at the East entrance to the town of Lauterbach, the road in the area of the bridge, where the "Tannenhof" and "Sieben Linden" hotels are, is fully closed.</seg>
<seg id="27">Altogether, the costs for the three bridge renovations total 700 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="28">The entire project is being funded by the state.</seg>

<seg id="1">AfD in Gerolstein: Colourful protest with German potato salad</seg>
<seg id="2">It doesn't happen that often that parties pull together, but when it concerns the Alternative for Germany (AfD), people come together who would otherwise be difficult to reconcile.</seg>
<seg id="3">The parties who represent in the Vulkan Eifel district council (CDU, SPD, the Greens, FDP, FWG, die Linke) belong to a broad alliance that is peacefully nailing its colours to the mast on this day because the AfD are holding a "big kick-off to the election campaign" in Gerolstein Town Hall plaza.</seg>
<seg id="4">And are launching famous names – like Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland makes up the leading duo for the Bundestag elections on 24th September, and the federal deputy chairwoman, Beatrix von Storch.</seg>
<seg id="5">But those who have been on site for hours already before the start of the event don't want to listen to the AfD, but rather, demonstrate.</seg>
<seg id="6">The motto: "Eifel is staying colourful."</seg>
<seg id="7">Originally the town picnic was planned for Brunnenplatz square under the motto "everyone at one table", but now is taking place in the carpark beneath the shopping plaza – and therefore directly in sight of those coming to the AfD event in the Town Hall.</seg>
<seg id="8">A colourful picture on show there.</seg>
<seg id="9">And what really delighted Christa Karoli, chairperson of the Eine Welt (One World) Forum and one of the leading organisers: "It's great how many people have come together here."</seg>
<seg id="10">There's music and all sorts of food, including a "typical German potato salad" that even the AfD would have no problem eating," said the woman who had brought it.</seg>
<seg id="11">The police had summoned lots of officials to Gerolstein and were above all also present at the train station, which is only a few metres away from the event locations.</seg>
<seg id="12">How did the AfD make it to Gerolstein, actually?</seg>
<seg id="13">Mario Hompe from the Vulkan Eifel AfD reports that he strove hard to get such an event and that he won the contract.</seg>
<seg id="14">The 45-year-old from Gönndersdorf had originally inquired in Daun, but had got a no there because there were not enough parking places available due to the St. Lawrence funfair already being set up.</seg>
<seg id="15">So now, the shopping plaza; Hompes is delighted that "we are able to hold such a wonderful event here".</seg>
<seg id="16">With a view to the event on the plaza forecourt he says: "It's the people's right. The main this is that it stays peaceful".</seg>
<seg id="17">And it does: at around 8pm some entertainment is provided, by a band on the plaza forecourt, and in the town hall, by various speakers, including Rhineland-Palatinate AfD chairman Uwe Junge.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the hall there are about 200 in attendance, waiting for the leading candidate for the Bundestag elections, Alice Weidel, and the federal deputy chairwoman, Beatrix von Storch, to give their speeches.</seg>
<seg id="19">The police presence is unchanged, but until now the officials have had a quiet evening.</seg>
<seg id="20">The AfD event lasts a little more than an hour; the guests in the forecourt have a long wind, but even there it is time to clear up shortly after 9pm.</seg>
<seg id="21">The police can go away – no specific incidents.</seg>

<seg id="2">There is another chance to hear Wolfach trombonist Frederic Belli in the series of Haslach cloister concerts tomorrow, Sunday, at 8pm in the monastery church.</seg>
<seg id="3">Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov, he is giving a concert that carries the slogan "The Black Sea meets the Black Forest", or even, "Balkan folklore" meets a classic German education with roots in brass music.</seg>

<seg id="5">So, Petkov is solo trumpeter with the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra in Amsterdam, and Frederic Belli is solo trombonist with the SWR Symphony Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="6">Both have in common a passion not only for transcending the boundaries of their instruments but also for conflating the boundaries of the various genres.</seg>
<seg id="7">So, Johann Sebastian Bach played by the two of them takes on a whole new sound, Daniel Schnyder's "Weltmusik" unites with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "Exchange Suits" from JazzEcho prize-winner Nils Wogram, they blend classical, jazz and free play into a fascinating complete art work.</seg>
<seg id="8">This centrepiece of the programme had its debut performance in Freiburg this spring, to great success.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday night at a rally with President Trump that he's switching parties.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Like it or not like it, the Democrats walked away from me," Gov. Justice said.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Today I will tell you with lots of prayers and lots of thinking ... today I will tell you as West Virginians, I can't help you anymore being a Democratic governor."</seg>
<seg id="5">The rally erupted in cheers.</seg>

<seg id="8">Mr. Trump promised earlier a big announcement at the West Virginia rally.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Trump won West Virginia by 42 points, and Justice did not endorse the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton.</seg>

<seg id="14">"With only 15 governorships and control of the fewest state legislatures in history, Governor Justice's announcement is just the latest rejection of a party that is leaderless from top to bottom and unable to find a positive, unifying message," RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.</seg>

<seg id="1">Coe praises 'candid' Russian apology for doping scandal</seg>
<seg id="2">Global athletics boss Sebastian Coe praised what he described as a candid apology from Russia over a doping scandal on Thursday but reiterated it was not the moment for the country to be readmitted to the sport.</seg>
<seg id="3">Russia's athletics boss Dmitry Shylakhtin told an IAAF Congress, held on the eve of the World Athletics Championships, that his country's ban from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.</seg>
<seg id="4">He said he was sorry to "all athletes who have had gold and silver medals snatched from them at competitions."</seg>
<seg id="5">Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favor of maintaining the ban, imposed in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I thought it was a very candid response today, a very candid presentation," IAAF president Coe told reporters.</seg>
<seg id="7">"The whole Council and the whole Congress was pleased ... that the Russian federation recognized themselves that they have been through some pretty torrid times and are doing everything possible to make sure the federation is reengineered."</seg>
<seg id="8">Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress is being made, but the Congress supports the recommendations of the task force that this was not the moment to reinstate Russia," said Coe.</seg>
<seg id="10">"We need to do everything over the next few months to normalize this situation.</seg>
<seg id="11">The guiding principle has always been that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the tainted system," he added</seg>
<seg id="12">Nineteen Russian athletes will be competing as neutrals at the World Athletics Championships which start in London on Friday, having met strict IAAF criteria.</seg>
<seg id="13">The head of the IAAF's Task Force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia had yet to meet several of the criteria for reinstatement.</seg>
<seg id="14">Drug-testing was still insufficient and banned coaches were still operating freely, he told reporters in London after a presentation to the IAAF Council.</seg>

<seg id="1">Act of mourning for soldiers who crashed in Mali</seg>
<seg id="2">At a memorial service in the north Hessen town of Fritzlar, around 1000 people commemorated both soldiers who lost their lives in a helicopter crash in Mali.</seg>
<seg id="3">The ceremony took place in the cathedral city on Thursday under strict security precautions.</seg>
<seg id="4">German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) remained silent on the as-yet-unexplained cause of the crash.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, she described the two pilots who were killed as "experts in their field".</seg>
<seg id="6">"We bow before this greatest of sacrifices that they have made in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany," she explained.</seg>
<seg id="7">The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old Stabshauptmann from north Hessen lost their lives a week ago, on Wednesday, in the West African country of Mali.</seg>
<seg id="8">Their coffins were transported back to Germany and on Thursday were brought to Saint Peter's cathedral in Fritzlar, accompanied by a wake from the German army.</seg>
<seg id="9">At midday, the relatives first said their goodbyes in the church.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then, amidst family and closest friends, the memorial service was begun by representatives of the German Army and the political world.</seg>
<seg id="11">Among these were Hesse Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and Inspector General of the German Army, Volker Wieker.</seg>
<seg id="12">Memorial guests laid down roses, and the relatives stood arm in arm by the coffins.</seg>
<seg id="13">The people of Fritzlar and numerous soldier followed the ceremony in front of the church on a big screen.</seg>
<seg id="14">Defence minister von der Leyen described the killed soldiers as "highly decorated" and experienced in missions.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Stabshauptmann is said to have helped set up flight operations of the combat helicopter Tiger in Fritzlar and was one of the first six qualified Tiger pilots in his regiment.</seg>
<seg id="16">Volker Bauersachs too, commander of the regiment to which the soldiers belonged, said: "If this crew were not able to prevent the crash, then no-one could have".</seg>
<seg id="17">Minister von der Leyen did not express any doubts about the UN mission in Mali: the mission was dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, it was also of great importance "for a country from which we are separated by only two nations," she said.</seg>
<seg id="19">After the memorial service, the coffins were brought out of the cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Germany Army did not wish to give any indications about when or where they are to be buried.</seg>

<seg id="2">The husband of the Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prinz Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.</seg>
<seg id="3">The royal family shared that on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="4">Traditionally, the Danish royal couple are interred in Roskilde Cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="5">The sculptor Bildhauer Bjørn Nørgaard is already crafting a sarcophagus for the two of them.</seg>
<seg id="6">The queen is content with her husband's decision, the announcement continued.</seg>
<seg id="7">Where Prince Henrik will be buried is still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, he does not intend to be interred in his French homeland.</seg>
<seg id="9">Prinz Henrik had never made a secret of the fact that he was not happy with his title.</seg>
<seg id="10">After his wife Margrethe's accession to the throne in 1972, he would have liked to have become king.</seg>
<seg id="11">In 2016, he went into retirement and at the same time also laid aside his title of "Prince Consort".</seg>
<seg id="12">Since Henrik did not get the title and function that he wanted in Denmark, he does not see himself as equal to his wife – not after death either, explains Lene Balleby, chief spokeswoman for the Danish royal family.</seg>
<seg id="13">Where the last place of rest will be in the end for the 83-year-old is still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, he does not intend to be interred in his French homeland, but rather in Denmark.</seg>
<seg id="15">He likes the country for which he has worked for the last 50 years.</seg>
<seg id="16">Born Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, the son of a noble French family, he had got to know Margrethe in 1965 in London.</seg>
<seg id="17">He worked on the Thames in the French Embassy.</seg>
<seg id="18">Whereas the people's expressions of sympathy always flew to his then to be wife, Prinz Henrik had a hard time with the Danes during his almost 50-year reign.</seg>
<seg id="19">In an autobiography, Henrik commented on his first years in Denmark: "A few months after my arrival, everything that I did was criticised.</seg>
<seg id="20">My Danish was faltering, I preferred wine to beer, silk socks to wool socks, Citroën to Volvo, tennis to football.</seg>
<seg id="21">Even for the Gauloises, which I smoked in place of Virginia tobacco, and which had the reputation here for being the brand of intellectuals who were critical of society, I could not hope for any leniency.</seg>
<seg id="22">I was different.</seg>
<seg id="23">It seemed I was happy with this position and not ashamed of it.</seg>

<seg id="2">CDU and FDP face possible majority in Lower Saxony</seg>
<seg id="3">Lower Saxony's prime minister Stephan Weil (SPD) wants the State Parliament to have a snap new election after the loss of the red-green governing majority – but he doesn't want to step down.</seg>
<seg id="4">Weil declared himself on Friday to be in favour of a dissolution of the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="5">Previously, the unexpected resignation of a Green party representative from her state parliamentary fraction in Lower Saxony had plunged Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD)'s government into a stark crisis.</seg>
<seg id="6">Five months before the official date of the state elections, the red-green coalition lost in Hanover, and with that, their scant one-vote majority in Parliament over the opposition of CDU and FDP.</seg>
<seg id="7">Elke Twesten, up until that point a Green Party representative, justified her move with the fact that she had not been nominated for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).</seg>
<seg id="8">"I see my political future in the CDU," she stated on Friday in Hanover.</seg>
<seg id="9">CDU parliamentary group leader Björn Thümler wants to advise his party to take her in.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the CDU and the FDP would together have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony State Parliament, and the Greens, 68 seats.</seg>
<seg id="11">Up until now, that ratio was the other way around.</seg>
<seg id="12">The new State Parliament will be elected as normal on the 14th January next year.</seg>
<seg id="13">Thümler says that the red-green State Government now has to decide whether it can continue to govern in these circumstances without a majority.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, Stephan Weil considers it imperative that the State Parliament vote to dissolve itself as swiftly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The CDU parliamentary group is expected to decide on Tuesday about how they will proceed.</seg>
<seg id="16">The state constitution also allows for the possibility that the State Parliament declares no confidence in the Prime Minister and elects a successor.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Our constitution offers various options.</seg>
<seg id="18">The possibilities have to be examined in a proper legal way," said Thümler.</seg>
<seg id="19">"All aspects will be debated in good time, if they are examined in a sound legal way."</seg>
<seg id="20">Thümler called Twesten's move "somewhat curious though".</seg>
<seg id="21">The politician herself stressed: "I am not a traitor.</seg>
<seg id="22">I feel very good."</seg>
<seg id="23">She described herself as a supporter of Black-Green.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Greens called on the defecting representative to give up her seat in Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="25">"We naturally assume that she will give up her seat in Parliament, which she won on a Green party ticket, with immediate effect," communicated state chairpersons Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Green Party chairwoman Anja Piel said: "We exceedingly regret Elke Twesten's decision".</seg>
<seg id="27">She consciously decided not to give any statement in the parliamentary group.</seg>
<seg id="28">"Especially given the background, that there were no essential differences – we can't understand this move."</seg>
<seg id="29">SPD candidate for Chancellor Martin Schulz denounced the crossing over of Lower Saxony Green representative Elke Twesten to the CDU as betrayal.</seg>
<seg id="30">"The behaviour of the former Green representative in Lower Saxony is not only a betrayal of voters, but also a betrayal to red-green," wrote the Social Democratic federal leader on Friday on Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="31">He supports Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD)'s decision to let the State Parliament have new elections soon.</seg>
<seg id="32">Twesten's resignation costs Red-Green the majority in Lower Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="33">The politician "in her wounded vanity and in her frustration" put "her personal interests above the wellbeing of the state," critisised SPD General Secretary Hubertus Heil.</seg>
<seg id="34">"It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony plays along in this dirty scheming and attempts to score political points from it."</seg>
<seg id="35">Lower Saxony CDU parliamentary group leader Björn Thümler wants to advise his representatives to take Elke Twesten into the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="36">The parliamentary group leader of the SPD in the Bundestag, Thomas Opperman, accused Twesten of distorting the result of the State election in 2013 with her personal career notions.</seg>
<seg id="37">The CDU was then the strongest power ahead of the SPD, but SPD and Greens had a wafer-thin majority of one vote in the State Parliament.</seg>

<seg id="1">Minister of Agriculture in interview – How do we protect ourselves against poisoned eggs, Mr Schmidt?</seg>
<seg id="2">Germany is discussing contaminated eggs.</seg>
<seg id="3">How was it possible for the scandal to happen?</seg>
<seg id="4">How can consumers protect themselves?</seg>
<seg id="5">Minister of Food and Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) answers our questions in interview with RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).</seg>
<seg id="6">Mr Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves against poisoned eggs?</seg>
<seg id="7">I can only encourage all consumers to look very carefully at the eggs in their fridge and check the stamps printed on them.</seg>
<seg id="8">The federal states are each supplying their most up-to-date information on the affected egg batches on the consumer protection portal www.Lebensmittelwarnung.de.</seg>
<seg id="9">Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.</seg>
<seg id="10">Even if, according to everything we know at this point in time, a health risk is all but ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="11">Is Aldi now adopting the best possible reaction to the crisis – removing all eggs from their offering – because the Federal Minister of Food and Agriculture is not really playing the central role of providing clear information?</seg>
<seg id="12">Monitoring foodstuffs is a task for the federal states.</seg>
<seg id="13">Despite that, the ministry immediately connected and has been liaising closely with the state authorities ever since it became known that Germany was affected.</seg>
<seg id="14">All information and the risk assessment are accessible to consumers.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is up to the trade just as much as it is the manufacturers to ensure that the products sold meet trading requirements and do not present any health risks.</seg>
<seg id="16">For eggs, if the maximum residue level of 0.005mg/kg is exceeded, then they do not meet trading requirements.</seg>
<seg id="17">Uncontaminated eggs, however, can be sold and consumed.</seg>
<seg id="18">This time the businesses are not at fault.</seg>
<seg id="19">Are production facilities and consumers in the same boat?</seg>
<seg id="20">According to what we currently know, the production facilities are not in any way directly to blame.</seg>
<seg id="21">In fact, due to suspected illegal practices by service companies, they have to deal with commercial claims.</seg>
<seg id="22">As always in emergencies, there are too few inspectors.</seg>
<seg id="23">Is it just the number of staff that is lacking, or the key competence as well?</seg>
<seg id="24">It was actually the official controls themselves that exposed what was going on.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, we must also remember that food fraud and criminal activity can never be 100% eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="26">It is for precisely this reason that it is so crucially important to have such occurrences thoroughly cleared up and passed over to public prosecutors in cases where crimes could have committed.</seg>
<seg id="27">I have already made it clear many times that I am expecting a complete resolution from the authorities in charge.</seg>
<seg id="28">Is the alarmism that regularly arises with food scandals really necessary?</seg>
<seg id="29">Consumers have the right to get only safe food that is approved for market.</seg>
<seg id="30">If a prohibited insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are quite right to be indignant.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks to these adulterated products, manufacturers, retailers and consumers get into a situation that is entirely unnecessary.</seg>
<seg id="32">Fundamentally the following has to be clear: the unlawful use of the insecticide Fipronil in the farming of food-producing animals is not acceptable and must be ended immediately.</seg>
<seg id="33">Work must be done on this consistently and urgently at all levels.</seg>
<seg id="34">I expect all responsible authorities to clear up the matter swiftly and completely.</seg>

<seg id="1">How soccer's financial rules impact Neymar's move to Paris</seg>
<seg id="2">Rules aimed at preventing unfettered spending by European soccer clubs will not disrupt Neymar's world-record transfer from Spain's Barcelona to France's Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="3">Any consequences will come further down the line for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, the governing body overseeing the European game which has the power to ban teams from the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="4">Financial Fair Play rules launched by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will eventually have to show that Neymar's transfer was funded without incurring huge losses.</seg>
<seg id="5">Barcelona has been paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to buy the Brazilian out of his contract and Neymar will command a salary that will run to tens of millions of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="6">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.</seg>
<seg id="7">PSG can certainly stump up the cash to sign Neymar and add him to a galaxy of other stars, given the team's funding from the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="8">Clubs are allowed to spend heavily on acquiring players but they have to counterbalance that with legitimate sources of income, allowing them to approach break-even on their football-related business.</seg>
<seg id="9">FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="10">The former France player believed that clubs who ran up huge debts in their pursuit of success were effectively cheating and risking ruin if banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="11">In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on clubs' debts to monitoring their losses instead.</seg>
<seg id="12">The change meant that the business model Roman Abramovich initially used at Chelsea in 2003 - buy a club with potential, and then spend heavily to improve the squad and build a global brand - become a tougher proposition.</seg>
<seg id="13">During the current three-year FFP assessment period that runs through 2018, clubs can incur losses of 30 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="14">And despite Platini being ousted in disgrace from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin is still committed to deterring excessive spending.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Certainly FFP is not dead and we will, for sure, reinforce the rules going forward," Andrea Traverso, who oversees FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.</seg>
<seg id="16">Although PSG will have paid Neymar's buyout clause in one lump sum, it can spread the amount for accounting purposes over the length of his contract.</seg>
<seg id="17">Neymar has signed a five-year deal, so the transfer fee could be shown as a 44.4 million-euro cost in the annual accounts for the next five years.</seg>
<seg id="18">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 saw PSG, along with Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City, hit with the heaviest sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="19">PSG was handed a fine of 60 million euros (then $82 million) - that was later reduced to 20 million euros - and ordered to limit its Champions League squads to 21 players for the 2014-15 season instead of the normal 25.</seg>
<seg id="20">UEFA is on the lookout for clubs who might try to outwit its financial regulators by inflating their income through companies linked to a club's owners.</seg>
<seg id="21">While a Qatari company could sponsor PSG, if the value of the sponsorship was deemed to exceed standard market rates UEFA would not allow it to count as legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="22">That is what happened in 2014 when UEFA ruled that the value of the Qatar Tourism Authority sponsorship of PSG was inflated.</seg>
<seg id="23">It has been reported that part of Neymar's PSG earnings could come via payments from the 2022 World Cup organizing committee in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="24">But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar will become a World Cup ambassador and such a maneuver would be easy for UEFA's regulators to expose.</seg>
<seg id="25">Past sanctions slapped on PSG means that UEFA will be even more watchful of any attempt to circumvent the rules.</seg>
<seg id="26">UEFA has not been in pre-emptive discussions with PSG about Neymar's transfer, people familiar with the situation said Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="27">They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="28">The last published accounts show that PSG made a profit of more than 10 million euros in 2015-16 on a turnover of 542.4 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="29">Accounts for the last financial year are yet to be published.</seg>
<seg id="30">PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a boon for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.</seg>
<seg id="31">The club expects turnover would grow by at least 30 percent on the back of the signing.</seg>
<seg id="32">Clearly irritated to see one of soccer's biggest players leaving, the Spanish league tried to stymie Neymar's move, claiming that PSG will be breaching FFP.</seg>
<seg id="33">"It is a clear case of 'financial doping', with the club and the state," La Liga President Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS, referring to Qatar's ultimate ownership of PSG.</seg>
<seg id="34">Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's reservations about a state funding a club.</seg>
<seg id="35">"It is the consequence of the ownerships and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years," Wenger said Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="36">"Once a country owns a club, everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="37">It becomes very difficult to respect the Financial Fair Play because you can have different ways or different interests for a country to have such a big player to represent a country."</seg>

<seg id="1">Swiss is on the look out for a new choccy supplier</seg>
<seg id="2">In the last few years, Chocolat Frey has made on-board chocolates for Swiss.</seg>
<seg id="3">Now the sweet collaboration faces a possible end: the airline is inviting new calls for tenders.</seg>
<seg id="4">Swiss spokeswoman Meike Fuhlrott, in response to a query from news agency sda, confirmed a corresponding report from the newspaper "Nordwestschweiz" on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to current plans, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half year of 2018.</seg>
<seg id="6">The products would be reviewed and undergo a quality control every two to three years.</seg>
<seg id="7">"We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolat Frey," said the spokeswoman.</seg>
<seg id="8">Every year, around 17 million small 14-gram chocolate bars packaged in red and white are handed out by the flight attendants to passengers before landing.</seg>
<seg id="9">Swiss did not wish to make any statements on the costs.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to "Nordwestschweiz", industry insiders estimate the order volumes to be 1.5 to 2 million francs – the Migros subsidiary generates an annual turnover of around a billion francs.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, more important is always the advertising effect: for a chocolate producer, it is a prestigious contract.</seg>
<seg id="12">Swiss will not disclose how many bidders there are for the new call for tenders.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, only Swiss producers are eligible.</seg>
<seg id="14">According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey wants to strive to renew the contract beyond Spring 2018.</seg>
<seg id="15">The biggest Swiss chocolate producer was not available to the sda for a statement.</seg>
<seg id="16">Swiss has been handing out chocolate bars on board their flights since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="17">Before Swiss concluded a contract with the Migros subsidiary, Barry Callebaut had supplied the chocolate bars, in collaboration with Hug.</seg>
<seg id="18">Swiss introduced the possibility of inserting a logo two and a half years ago, at the start of the collaboration with Chocolat Frey.</seg>
<seg id="19">The airline collaborates with various Swiss chocolate manufacturers.</seg>
<seg id="20">On long-haul flights, the first class customers are spoiled with treats from confectioner Sprüngli; in business class, passengers nibble on chocolate from Lindt, and in economy class, chocolate from Chocolat Frey.</seg>
<seg id="21">On short-haul routes too, Swiss hands out chocolate from Chocolate Frey, both in business and in economy class.</seg>

<seg id="1">Nostalgia Goes Niche in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"</seg>
<seg id="2">So this iteration of the story is simultaneously nostalgic for the characters' '80s glory days; for the '90s grunge era (around when the masterminds David Wain and Michael Showalter made the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV); and for itself - that is, for 2001, before its stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went on to bigger things.</seg>
<seg id="3">As a cultural artifact, it's both a sendup and embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent reminiscence.</seg>
<seg id="4">But as a franchise, it feels like it's running out of time.</seg>
<seg id="5">"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurdist humor (it included an origin story for a talking can of vegetables, voiced by H. Jon Benjamin).</seg>
<seg id="6">By doubling down on the core gag - middle-age actors playing horny kids coming of age - it made the impossibility of recapturing the past part of the joke.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Ten Years Later," with its adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and its parody more scattershot, including a riff on '90s stalker flicks like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle."</seg>
<seg id="8">At one point a character rummages through an Apple Powerbook, some in-line skates and "a bunch of other things from 1991."</seg>
<seg id="9">Many of the core stories are the same.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sweet-hearted Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, still hasn't gotten over Katie (Marguerite Moreau).</seg>
<seg id="11">Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost his virginity.</seg>
<seg id="12">And there's another battily villainous plot involving Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), now abetted by George H. W. Bush (a well-inhabited impression by Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="13">As always, the best part of the franchise is the digressions.</seg>
<seg id="14">It's especially fun to see the forever-young Mr. Rudd, sporting Matt Dillon's soul patch from "Singles," whose former big-man-on-camp Andy now feels like a geezer.</seg>
<seg id="15">It's the moments of random lunacy that might power this franchise on, like a kind of recursive "Seven Up!" series, until it reaches what I assume will be its logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose last scene will have the gang going to see the movie premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Comrade Detective" on Amazon, meanwhile, appeals to a different brand of nostalgia: the Cold War revivalism of "The Americans," the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW," with its East versus West wrestling iconography.</seg>
<seg id="17">The comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, with Rhys Thomas directing, purports to be found TV: a Romanian 1980s buddy-cop drama about two Bucharest officers fighting for truth, atheism and the Marxist-Leninist way.</seg>
<seg id="18">The lead roles - hard-boiled Gregor and idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, their dialogue dubbed in English by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.</seg>
<seg id="19">It's a brilliant idea.</seg>
<seg id="20">But it's not much more than an idea.</seg>
<seg id="21">There are some fine sight gags (the police pass the time watching chess on TV as Americans might football).</seg>
<seg id="22">And the roster of famous voice-over actors - among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - makes for a decent game of spot-the-voice.</seg>
<seg id="23">But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the verisimilitude of a hamfisted propaganda drama - a killer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like one.</seg>
<seg id="24">At six long episodes, it drags, and the comedy isn't fast or frequent enough.</seg>
<seg id="25">Edited to a tighter length, "Comrade Detective" might deliver better on its agitprop satire, as when Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two fat men wolfing down a pile of hamburgers.</seg>
<seg id="26">The message, for the imagined communist audience, is that Western culture can turn anything into fodder to binge.</seg>
<seg id="27">The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: We even do it with our own recent history, and theirs.</seg>

<seg id="1">Blow dealt to drug mafia in the country</seg>
<seg id="2">The police have delivered a successful blow against the Italian Mafia in Baden Württemberg.</seg>
<seg id="3">On Wednesday morning, in the Black Forest-Baar district, numerous properties were searched in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, said the Konstanz public prosecutor's office on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the course of this, 15 accused, aged between 25 and 77, were detained and already had arrest warrants issued against them.</seg>
<seg id="5">In addition, officials seized large quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros.</seg>
<seg id="6">At simultaneous raids in Italy, two people were detained.</seg>
<seg id="7">German arrest warrants were issued against the two suspected Italians.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both of them were therefore presumably extradited to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="9">Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the operation.</seg>
<seg id="10">In total, over 300 policemen were deployed.</seg>
<seg id="11">The mafia members were charged with organised drug-related crime, serious acts of violence, attempted murder, and robbery and extortion.</seg>
<seg id="12">Konstanz public prosecutor's office has been investigating the drug trade in southern Germany since the summer of 2016 already.</seg>
<seg id="13">There was an active exchange between the public prosecutor's offices in Konstanz and Palermo, and the investigators from Rottweil CID had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.</seg>
<seg id="14">The major operation on Wednesday morning was thus attended by four officials from Palermo.</seg>
<seg id="15">The investigations then turned their sights above all to Italian nationals with close ties to the Italian mafia.</seg>
<seg id="16">An incident on 27th May in Hüfingen, during which several shots were fired into a restaurant in the early morning, is also likely to have been caused by the gang.</seg>

<seg id="2">"Data for citizens that ought not to be showing up there": according to a report, the Register of Foreigner Nationals in Germany is exhibiting significant defects.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is leading to some grave mistakes in decisions within asylum procedures.</seg>
<seg id="4">Frank-Jürgen Weise, the official appointee of the German Government for the management of refugees, has brought attention to big holes in the Central Register of Foreign Nationals, according to one media report.</seg>
<seg id="5">Defects in the data registered there could lead to "some grave mistakes in decisions" when it comes to asylum procedures and deportations, warned Weise in an analysis received by the Süddeutsche Zeitung.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to that information, ten million people with foreign nationality are recorded in the register, among whom around 5.7 million from non-EU states.</seg>
<seg id="7">The data are managed by around 600 Foreigners' Registration Offices in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="8">Because the data have not been sufficiently maintained, it said, the quality of the data has in part not been good to date.</seg>
<seg id="9">In some cases, data from 1921 was found, "from people who have long been dead, or from citizens who became German nationals and actually should no longer be showing up in the register."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Erroneous data entries can significantly slow down return processes," the report continues.</seg>
<seg id="11">Moreover, within the statistics on those people who are obliged to leave the country are recorded EU citizens, who do not at all have to leave.</seg>
<seg id="12">Such false categorisations, however, led to "a biased debate about how to deal with those who are obliged to leave the country," it says accordingly in the analysis.</seg>
<seg id="13">Meanwhile, the German Government has apparently begun to send back to Italy refugee families with children under 16 years of age, if this is where they entered the country from.</seg>
<seg id="14">This is emerging from an internal paper from the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung".</seg>
<seg id="15">In the paper, it says that the BAMF has been once more transacting such procedures "that concern families with children – with the exception of infants and very small children – to Italy since 1st June 2017."</seg>
<seg id="16">Since the end of 2014, that had practically no longer been possible, says the newspaper, pointing to the difficult situation on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the Dublin Regulation, it is the EU state the refugee first reaches that is responsible for them.</seg>
<seg id="18">If a migrant travels further into another EU country, this state can send him back to the country he entered from.</seg>
<seg id="19">As a means of justification, the office writes: "By now, the intake capacity for families with children who are minors has significantly increased in Italy."</seg>
<seg id="20">Italy has provided guarantees for the intake and accommodation of families.</seg>
<seg id="21">The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) itself considers these pledges to be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="22">Other EU states too would send back refugees there using the scope of the Dublin Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Linke party's spokeswoman for domestic poicy, Ulla Elpke, criticised this decision: "Due to shortcomings in the Italian asylum system, families with children are threatened with conditions of admission that contravene human rights and with risk to the child's welfare"</seg>

<seg id="2">Altogether, the blood donor service made 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach available for others.</seg>
<seg id="3">At least, from the twelve citizens who were honoured on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ahead of everyone is Jürgen Greule, who has by now shared 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations.</seg>
<seg id="5">The community traditionally acknowledges the repeated willingness to give blood in the meeting of its municipal council.</seg>
<seg id="6">"It is ingenious how our bodies are designed for this and we show respect to the donors who make their blood available for strangers, and so selflessly," stressed mayor Karlheinz Kistner.</seg>
<seg id="7">"One single blood donation helps multiple people," explained the district head of the on-call service of the German Red Cross (DRK), Holger Maisenbacher, for the reserves are broken down into their components.</seg>
<seg id="8">So, as many as three people could benefit from a single blood donation.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time, Maisenbacher reported on the campaigns that are to be carried out in Oberreichenbach in the spring.</seg>
<seg id="10">"This year, we achieved our second best result ever, with 114 donors," said the DRK on-call district head.</seg>
<seg id="11">Obviously the move into the theatre venue a few years ago led to a higher number of participants.</seg>
<seg id="12">Already before then, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were numbered amongst the repeat donors and honoured for having made 50 donations each.</seg>

<seg id="1">Bank of England to keep interest rates at 0.25%</seg>
<seg id="2">The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after lacklustre economic growth and easing inflation dampened speculation over a hike.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Bank of England has warned economic growth will remain "sluggish" as it kept interest rates on hold amid a tightening squeeze on family incomes.</seg>
<seg id="4">Policymakers on the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6-2 to keep rates at 0.25%, with fewer members this month calling for a rise as lacklustre economic growth has weakened support for a hike.</seg>
<seg id="5">In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank cut its forecasts for growth to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and cautioned the squeeze on household incomes would continue, with inflation still expected to surge close to 3% in the autumn.</seg>
<seg id="6">But it signalled rate hikes will be needed over the next few years to rein in Brexit-fuelled inflation and said borrowing costs may need to rise by more than expected in financial markets.</seg>
<seg id="7">Members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth economy-boosting package unleashed a year ago in the aftermath of Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="8">It will call time on the Term Funding Scheme to offer cheap-finance to banks from next February, although it said it was now expected to offer £15 billion more under the scheme - at £115 billion.</seg>
<seg id="9">In minutes of the rates decision, the Bank said: "In the MPC's central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) remains sluggish in the near-term as the squeeze on households' real incomes continues to weigh on consumption."</seg>
<seg id="10">On rates, it reiterated that "some tightening of monetary policy" would be needed to cool inflation and by a "somewhat greater" extent than markets expect.</seg>
<seg id="11">Markets are currently forecasting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="12">But the Bank stressed that any hikes would be "gradual" and "limited."</seg>
<seg id="13">The Bank's downgraded growth forecasts for this year and next compare with the 1.9% and 1.7% predicted in May.</seg>
<seg id="14">It maintained its forecast for growth of 1.8% in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sterling fell against the dollar and the euro following the news.</seg>
<seg id="16">The pound was 0.5% down at 1.31 US dollars and fell 0.4% to 1.11 euros.</seg>
<seg id="17">The no-change decision comes after recent disappointing growth figures have dampened mounting expectations of a hike, with GDP edging up to 0.3% in the second quarter from 0.2% in the previous three months.</seg>
<seg id="18">Growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will start to pick up slightly at the end of the year, according to the Bank.</seg>
<seg id="19">Its latest inflation report offered little cheer for households being hit by soaring inflation and paltry pay rises as it said the squeeze will get worse before it gets better.</seg>
<seg id="20">It added that monetary policy "cannot prevent" the hit to incomes over the next few years, but expects wages will recover "significantly" towards the end of its three-year forecast.</seg>
<seg id="21">The economy is also set for a boost from surging demand for British goods thanks to the weak pound, which will offset some of the lower consumer spending.</seg>
<seg id="22">The decision comes a year after rates were cut to 0.25% last August following the shock EU referendum vote, which sent the pound slumping.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Bank estimates it will likely take four years to fully feed through to prices and the economy.</seg>
<seg id="24">Prior to the Bank's latest rates verdict, there had been growing clamour for a rate rise as inflation ramped up pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers calling for an increase to 0.5% in July.</seg>
<seg id="25">Inflation eased back to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, although the Bank said this was expected and will pick up once again over the coming months.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Bank said the overshoot relative to its 2% target was "entirely" down to the weak pound.</seg>
<seg id="27">Andrew Montlake, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent fall in swap rates, the mortgage market looks set to become ever more competitive once more as lenders clamour for business and look to end the year in positive fashion.</seg>
<seg id="28">The market looks particularly good for those who may be coming to the end of their existing deals as re-mortgages, many with fee-free options as well as low rates, become ever more popular."</seg>

<seg id="1">NHS to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000</seg>
<seg id="2">Patients will be able to access a 'transformative' HIV prevention treatment from September following a High Court battle over funding the drug on the NHS.</seg>
<seg id="3">NHS England announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a pill taken before sex which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in high-risk individuals by around 86 per cent, will now be provided by the health service through an initial three-year trial to an estimated 10,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="4">It agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal upheld a High Court ruling last year, which said the NHS had the power to pay for PrEP despite its claims that local authorities should fund it.</seg>
<seg id="5">The move announced on Thursday was hailed as a 'major new intervention' by NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described it as a 'pivotal moment'.</seg>
<seg id="6">Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start enrolling people, with more clinics joining in October before full implementation across England by April 2018.</seg>
<seg id="7">Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a course of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of getting HIV.</seg>
<seg id="8">Trials have shown PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission among those at-risk of infection.</seg>
<seg id="9">Taking PrEP before sex means there is just enough of certain drugs in a person's body to prevent an HIV infection taking hold.</seg>
<seg id="10">Such drugs can be taken every day or as soon as two hours before having sex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Those eligible for the treatment include gay or bisexual men, transgender people and those with HIV-positive partners who are not successfully receiving treatment.</seg>
<seg id="12">Clinics will identify eligible participants who consent to the trial, including men, women, transgender people, and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti-retroviral treatment.</seg>
<seg id="13">People living and registered with a GP in England will also be able to enrol for potential participation at their local participating sexual health clinic.</seg>
<seg id="14">The programme will cost £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to source the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement.</seg>
<seg id="15">The trial is designed to assess the full potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence on how it is targeted, taken up, and implemented on a large scale.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mr Stevens said: 'This major new intervention should complement and supercharge the wide-ranging and increasingly successful effort to prevent HIV.</seg>
<seg id="17">It's another milestone in more than three decades' worth of progress in tackling one of humanity's major health challenges.'</seg>
<seg id="18">Deborah Gold, chief executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: 'This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV.</seg>
<seg id="19">PrEP, if targeted properly at those in need and at risk, offers the possibility of transforming the English HIV epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="20">From September, people at high risk of HIV will have access via this NHS-funded trial in England to an empowering new tool that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.</seg>
<seg id="21">We warmly welcome this announcement.'</seg>
<seg id="22">Ian Green, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: 'The priority must now be to make sure that the trial is rolled out speedily across the country, and that no-one at risk of HIV is left behind.</seg>
<seg id="23">Now that the PrEP trial drug has been procured, we're well on the way to protecting over 10,000 people at risk of HIV.'</seg>
<seg id="24">Shadow public health minister Sharon Hodgson said: 'The start of the PrEP trial is welcome and long overdue after months of delays and heel-dragging by the Government.</seg>
<seg id="25">The evidence shows just how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and ending the transmission of this life-changing infection.</seg>
<seg id="26">This trial will take us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.</seg>
<seg id="27">Now it is important that this trial is rolled out as quickly as possible across the country to protect individuals who are exposed to HIV and help take us one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society.'</seg>

<seg id="1">Living the high life: mezzanine floor and clever design tricks have transformed this small Earls Court flat into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="2">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for doing up property, downsized from a large home in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is on the first floor of a smart Queen Anne terrace - and it is a testament to the new design that Joanne hasn't packed her bags and sold on.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Before this, I was living with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger space," Joanne says.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I was looking for something that was comparable for my price.</seg>
<seg id="6">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="7">I fell in love with it and put an offer in that day."</seg>
<seg id="8">Since the first viewing, the 1,000sq ft flat has had a complete overhaul.</seg>
<seg id="9">Originally a one-bedroom property with a convoluted layout - you had to walk through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make the most of the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="11">That was my requirement," she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">To this end, she employed Erfan Azadi of Notting Hill-based architecture and design studio Duck & Shed to exploit the 12.5ft ceilings and create a home that wasn't only a development but a place for Joanne to live.</seg>
<seg id="13">The ceiling wasn't quite tall enough to add two spaces on top of each other so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine that you could stand up in.</seg>
<seg id="14">Erfan had to think creatively to resolve the brief.</seg>
<seg id="15">"The steelwork is quite complicated," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="16">"We had to arrange the spaces so that they stacked on top of each other without needing to hunch down.</seg>
<seg id="17">It wasn't just building a simple platform, but cranking the steels so that they were at the right height for the function above or below."</seg>
<seg id="18">This arrangement allowed Erfan to get two full-height rooms on top of each other in the space - with lots of added drama.</seg>
<seg id="19">For the mezzanine, a vintage copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area below.</seg>
<seg id="20">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting all set the style for the scheme.</seg>
<seg id="21">The use of mirrors plays a part in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="22">A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to make it appear longer.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the kitchen, the mirrored splashback feels like a window to another room.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the entrance, mirrored units provide storage for all Joanne's cutlery and glassware.</seg>
<seg id="25">Giving the perception of a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room is being able to close off the kitchen when it's not in use.</seg>
<seg id="26">Foldaway kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="27">What's unique about this one is that it's a garage-style lift-up door.</seg>
<seg id="28">"A bit of engineering went into that," explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door.</seg>
<seg id="29">"It's counter-weighted so that when you push the door up, it glides really easily."</seg>
<seg id="30">Thanks to clever use of space and storage, Joanne gained an additional 16sq m, an extra bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="31">"At the end of the day, floor space is what you are going to sell - or how your property is valued," Erfan says.</seg>
<seg id="32">"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will walk in and do a calculation based on floor size."</seg>
<seg id="33">Here they have managed to increase the floor space while using quality materials that give the space its luxurious edge.</seg>
<seg id="34">"The materials are the things that you touch and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="35">"You don't fall in love with the electrical feeds in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="36">These are important but they don't pull the heart strings."</seg>
<seg id="37">It goes to show that through good design and increased square metreage, a flat can turn from something standard into something quite amazing.</seg>
<seg id="38">In fact, like Joanne, you may choose not to leave.</seg>

<seg id="1">Brothers fight over $500 million property empire</seg>
<seg id="2">Two brothers are at war over one of Victoria's biggest real estate empires, worth more than $500 million, four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty.</seg>
<seg id="3">Former Carlton Football Club director and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a Toorak mansion three doors from younger brother Paul, who has taken him to the Supreme Court over how their property and business assets will be sliced up.</seg>
<seg id="4">Paul has wanted out of the family business since 2014 but an acrimonious argument is playing out in the Supreme Court over the break-up.</seg>
<seg id="5">Together with their mother Anna the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, amassed since the family bought a Smith Street, Collingwood, shop in 1973.</seg>
<seg id="6">There, the family founded Westco Jeans and grew it into a chain of 160 retail outlets.</seg>
<seg id="7">It sold in 1999 for $85 million.</seg>
<seg id="8">That money was sunk into property and the De Lutis portfolio now includes city offices, Brunswick and Sorrento development sites, Gold Coast and Mt Buller apartments, and suburban shopping centres.</seg>
<seg id="9">Under an agreement with their late father, Colin - described by Paul as "the major driving force and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company assets and Paul about one-third.</seg>
<seg id="10">A court filing says this translates to Colin owning property worth $316 million and Paul $176 million.</seg>
<seg id="11">Dividing the properties and cash has proved the sticking point for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The splits proposed by Colin left him with what I considered to be the best properties," he wrote in an initial court affidavit in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last Friday, after several failed mediations, the first Supreme Court hearing was held.</seg>
<seg id="14">The brothers are also now fighting over who controls the existing business - which Paul alleges Colin has locked him out of.</seg>
<seg id="15">Colin argues this is not true, but accuses Paul of incompetently managing some properties.</seg>
<seg id="16">In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to resolve the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="17">"My Italian heritage dictates that family is the most important priority," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="18">Costs are mounting in the case, with hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails and reports by companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer filed and top barristers including Allan Myers, QC, and senior solicitors retained by both sides.</seg>
<seg id="19">Ms De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran milk bars and delicatessens from the late 1950s and in the early 1970s bought a shop in Brunswick.</seg>
<seg id="20">They used the collateral to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the family's first jeans store.</seg>
<seg id="21">Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my final years of high school, when Paul was a young child (around 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="22">Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass down their properties to their sons amicably.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to end up in court," she wrote.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies, with Colin saying that Mark was paid $10 million when he left the business, and Luke $26 million.</seg>
<seg id="25">Both Luke and Mark had become, Paul says, "bitter about the terms of their financial separation."</seg>
<seg id="26">Colin has kept a low profile despite being a former AFL club board member and, according to a 2015 biography of Eddie McGuire, the television star's best friend.</seg>
<seg id="27">Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis on Friday, and their lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="28">Only Colin replied, by text message, to say that because the case was before the courts "I really cannot say much."</seg>
<seg id="29">"It's very, very sad that my brother Paul has chosen to sue me and drag our family name through the courts," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="30">In mid-2016, Colin wrote in one court filing that he had tried to accommodate his brother's requests.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Our father would not have wanted to see Paul and I end up in our current dispute," he said, adding that he was "still hopeful of resolution."</seg>
<seg id="32">On Friday, that hope appeared gone.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.</seg>

<seg id="1">Trump's new chief of staff plans to restrict the president's media diet.</seg>
<seg id="2">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="3">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="4">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="5">Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - in the hope of keeping the boss on a more even keel.</seg>
<seg id="6">Here's a bit from reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="7">"When new White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly huddled with senior staff on his first day at work, he outlined a key problem in President Donald Trump's White House that he planned to fix: bad information getting into the president's hands.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kelly told the staff that information needed to flow through him - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if given good information."</seg>
<seg id="9">Kelly's diagnosis makes perfect sense, but others have tried and failed to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.</seg>
<seg id="10">President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades - and now that he's in the White House, his TV-watching habit is still going strong.</seg>
<seg id="11">"If candidate Trump was upset about unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he was getting fair coverage from outlets that were persuadable," Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico in February.</seg>
<seg id="12">Politico's Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady stream of praise."</seg>
<seg id="13">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="14">But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit has ever been "under control" is laughable.</seg>
<seg id="15">Maybe these campaign officials know something the rest of us don't - that Trump's tweets would have been even more inflammatory if not for their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="16">We'll probably never know about tweets that Trump didn't send.</seg>
<seg id="17">If his staffers managed to him out of trouble even a few times, then their efforts were worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="18">But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from stirring up controversy.</seg>
<seg id="19">Part of the problem is that in a White House composed of competing factions, people invariably try to advance their agendas by presenting Trump with material - which may or may not be reliable - that promotes their worldviews.</seg>
<seg id="20">Politico - all over this story - reported in May on advisers' penchants for strategically feeding dubious information to the president.</seg>
<seg id="21">This was one example, described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="22">"Current and former Trump officials say Trump can react volcanically to negative press clips, especially those with damaging leaks, becoming engrossed in finding out where they originated.</seg>
<seg id="23">That is what happened in late February when someone mischievously gave the president a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, which accused deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of being 'the source behind a bunch of leaks' in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="24">No matter that Johnson had been permanently banned from Twitter for harassment or that he offered no concrete evidence or that he had lobbed false accusations in the past and recanted them.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trump read the article and began asking staff about Walsh."</seg>
<seg id="26">Goldmacher added that then-chief of staff Reince Priebus and White House staff secretary Rob Porter "have tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork Trump receives."</seg>
<seg id="27">How'd that work out?</seg>
<seg id="28">Kelly is trying to do the same thing, three months later.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perhaps he will prove a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his aides are still vying for influence.</seg>
<seg id="30">Those immutable factors will make Kelly's mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="2">Some of the West Midlands' wealthiest homeowners are again at loggerheads with determined travellers who have negotiated a council-dug trench to reclaim a field outside their mansions.</seg>
<seg id="3">The travellers have parked their 20 caravans in a field outside a prosperous street of Solihull dubbed 'millionaire's row'.</seg>
<seg id="4">Bringing horses, babies and an army of vans, they have returned after being kicked out only in May, undeterred by a moat dug by the council to prevent their incursions.</seg>
<seg id="5">The tactful group found a gap in the defences, squeezing their vehicles though a section left unbarricaded to accommodate a pathway.</seg>
<seg id="6">Furious residents have savaged Solihull Council saying it was 'useless at dealing with the problem'.</seg>
<seg id="7">One anonymous resident said: 'They moved there on Monday night after being moved on from Bentley Heath where they were throwing rocks at passers by.</seg>
<seg id="8">The council needs to be shamed into action as they are useless at dealing with the problem.</seg>
<seg id="9">The travellers were there in May, were moved on and now they are back again.</seg>
<seg id="10">More arrived last night, probably even more today.'</seg>
<seg id="11">She added: 'Birmingham council knows how to deal with this by getting long injunctions to protect their parks.</seg>
<seg id="12">I live on Streetsbrook road and I'm not happy to continue paying my council tax when the council can't even stop this.'</seg>
<seg id="13">One local resident who did not wish to be named said: 'It is ridiculous, we have only just seen the last round of these travellers leaving, only to be blighted by another round.</seg>
<seg id="14">The numbers have increased this time and a horse has even been seen grazing on the parkland.'</seg>
<seg id="15">A spokeswoman for Solihull Council said: 'We are aware of an unauthorised encampment on land off Streetsbrook Road and working alongside Solihull Police, we are undertaking the necessary legal actions to move them on as quickly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="16">To support our evidence gathering it is very important that as many local residents as possible report any anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.</seg>
<seg id="17">This helps build a picture of the situation for the court to consider when we present our case to them.'</seg>

<seg id="1">Birkenhof becomes Waldhotel Luise</seg>
<seg id="2">The former Hotel Birkenhof is being turned into the Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="3">The house just outside Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and should be opened again on 1st March next year.</seg>
<seg id="4">That is good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="5">For when the Hotel Birkenhof was closed by former operating company Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on 13th April 2014, at the time around 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost, and with that, the income from the visitors' taxes.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the autumn of 2014, in the face of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who were coming into the rural district, the hotel building was offered to the district administration as collective housing, which sparked controversial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="7">The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by preparing development plans to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="8">The decision passed in the municipal council back then without controversy.</seg>
<seg id="9">Yet Freudenstadt's lord mayor, Julian Osswald, in particular, defended the hotel location and already back then spoke of serious interested parties in the establishment.</seg>
<seg id="10">And he was right.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Luisenhotels Group, with Managing Director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to return it to being an establishment in the three-stars-or-more category, under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="12">The group has four establishments including the Freudenstadt property.</seg>
<seg id="13">Two of them are in Bad Bergzabern, and one is in Bad Herrenalb.</seg>
<seg id="14">They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and, now, Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="15">There has been a skip standing in front of the entrance to the former Hotel Birkenhof for a long time now, and when you enter the building, it becomes clear just how extensive the refurbishment works are that are being undertaken.</seg>
<seg id="16">The floors have been ripped out, ceilings partly dismantled, old bath tubs taken out of the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="17">The entire hotel building is one big construction site.</seg>
<seg id="18">There is still a lot to do before March.</seg>
<seg id="19">"It is truly a beautiful hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our paper.</seg>
<seg id="20">Everything is to be redone in the Black Forest style.</seg>
<seg id="21">The rooms are being kitted out with large, walk-in showers, the entrance foyer is being revamped, new windows are being installed.</seg>
<seg id="22">Everything should later become "beautifully in touch with the people", is how Thomas Scherer expressed it.</seg>
<seg id="23">"We want to make a gem of it."</seg>
<seg id="24">Swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room are part of the facilities.</seg>
<seg id="25">One doesn't want to position oneself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but still at an elevated downtown level, stressed Scherer.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Waldhotel Luise, with its roughly 60 rooms, wants to set itself up for a broad audience, explains Scherer further.</seg>
<seg id="27">Individual holiday-makers, groups, and business people, should all feel at home in the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="28">Scherer said that he had already had conversations with Lord Mayor Julian Osswald and Director of Tourism Michael Krause.</seg>
<seg id="29">The city's expectations are said to be in line with those of the hotel group.</seg>
<seg id="30">"We're on the same page."</seg>
<seg id="31">Asked about the level of investments, Thomas Scherer doesn't want to commit himself precisely.</seg>
<seg id="32">A little under a million euros, he reckons.</seg>
<seg id="33">The outside facilities are also being revamped – that can already be seen.</seg>
<seg id="34">In an inner courtyard, a large terrace is taking shape, which will be accessible from the restaurant, which is public.</seg>
<seg id="35">Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market."</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia affair: US Special Counsel convenes grand jury</seg>
<seg id="2">In the Russia affair surrounding US President Donald Trump, Special Counsel Robert Mueller is said to have convened a so-called grand jury, according to one report.</seg>
<seg id="3">The panel started work in recent weeks, wrote the "Wall Street Journal", relying on sources intimately acquainted with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="4">The newspaper judged the step to be a sign that Mueller has broadened and intensified his investigations.</seg>
<seg id="5">The broadcaster CNN reported that the panel has already issued its first subpoenas in connection with a meeting between Trump's oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="6">US secret service has long been accusing the Kremlin of purposefully interfering in the 2016 presidential election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mueller is investigating whether there was any collusion between Trump's campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="8">Several men who acted as Republican advisers during the election campaign are said to stand at the centre of the investigations.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to reports, Mueller has been subjecting Trump's private and business circles to more and more scrutiny.</seg>
<seg id="10">The "Washington Post" wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Counsel has personally shifted the centre of focus onto Trump and is investigating the charge of whether or not the President could have obstructed the course of justice during the affair.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is the main task of the grand jury to review the available evidence in cases of possible felonies and to decide whether charges should be brought.</seg>
<seg id="12">Grand juries are for this reason also called prosecution chambers.</seg>
<seg id="13">They are usually engaged for major and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">The procedure always takes place behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="15">The panel may also be engaged by the public prosecutor's office to subpoena people for questioning under oath.</seg>
<seg id="16">According to the broadcaster CNN, subpoenas have already been issued in relation to a meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="17">People who had been involved in this meeting had been summoned to give evidence, the report said.</seg>
<seg id="18">They were also supposed to make documents available.</seg>
<seg id="19">In addition to Trump Jr., Trump's adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his former campaign manager Paul Manafort were also present at the meeting.</seg>
<seg id="20">Legal experts said on US television on Thursday evening that the convening shows that Mueller will not let himself be intimidated in his work and that he is willing to act quickly, should that be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="21">However, this does not necessarily mean that the grand jury is ultimately being engaged in order to decide whether to bring charges.</seg>
<seg id="22">Nevertheless, the convening of the panel signals the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and gives President Trump a new cause for concern.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the midst of these new revelations, the President took advantage of a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening in order to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="24">"The Russia story is a total fabrication," said Trump.</seg>
<seg id="25">He said the subject gives Democrats an opportunity "to feel better when they have nothing else to talk about."</seg>
<seg id="26">His special adviser Ty Cobb explained in a statement that he knew nothing about the convening of a grand jury.</seg>
<seg id="27">But it usually operates in secret, he stressed.</seg>
<seg id="28">The White House supports any measures that speed up the work of the Special Counsel in a "fair" way.</seg>
<seg id="29">Former head of the FBI James Comey said three times that the President was not under investigation, he said.</seg>
<seg id="30">There is no reason to presume that anything has changed, his statement continued.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, Mueller was only engaged after Trump had fired Comey.</seg>
<seg id="32">Due to the sacking, accusations were raised that he wanted to obstruct the course of justice.</seg>
<seg id="33">Comey stated before a Senate committee in June that Trump had asked him to put an end to the investigations into former national security adviser Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="34">The President was under a lot of pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="35">As the US media portrays it, the White House gathered materials against the Special Counsel and his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="36">This gave rise to speculations about whether Trump wanted to dismiss Mueller.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unlike an independent Special Counsel of Congress, such as, for example, in the Watergate scandal concerning President Richard Nixon, who later stepped down, Mueller is in a position where, in theory, he could be fired by the justice department if the President pushed for it.</seg>
<seg id="38">However, various senators, from both parties, want to avoid such a move.</seg>
<seg id="39">Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators proposed draft legislation on Thursday that would make it no longer so easy for the Special Counsel to be dismissed.</seg>

<seg id="1">Antarctica: Gigantic iceberg drifts into the Antarctic</seg>
<seg id="2">In the West Antarctic, a gigantic iceberg almost seven times the size of Berlin has detached from the ice shelf.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven communicated this on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="4">The over a trillion-ton-heavy and 5800-square-kilometre-big colossus is now drifting to the north and will probably need two or three years to melt.</seg>
<seg id="5">With a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have recorded in the last three decades.</seg>
<seg id="6">It does not pose any danger for men.</seg>
<seg id="7">The extent to which climate change had a part to play in the iceberg breaking off is unclear from the research scientists' findings.</seg>
<seg id="8">Nevertheless, altogether, there have been a series of unusual collapses of ice shelves in the region for around 30 years now, writes the US research centre for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a background fact report.</seg>
<seg id="9">Many researchers believe this could be connected to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="10">The now detached colossus was previously a part of the Larsen C ice shelf.</seg>
<seg id="11">Shelf ice floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="12">It thereby grows out ever further into the sea and regularly breaks off.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Larsen C ice shelf is located south of South America, almost at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="14">The equilibrium between growing and breaking off became disrupted north of this ice shelf a few years ago.</seg>
<seg id="15">An entire ice shelf crumbled there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="16">There is some evidence that the Larsen C ice shelf is in danger too, for the front edge has never retreated so far back as it currently is.</seg>
<seg id="17">What is more, the ice sheet is under tension and could crumble if a piece breaks off at a key point.</seg>
<seg id="18">The melting of shelf ice and icebergs do not raise sea water levels, since they float on the water and ice displaces as much water as it itself produces after melting.</seg>
<seg id="19">However, the loss of the ice shelf leads to the glaciers feeding directly into the sea, and being able to flow out much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="20">The could potentially raise sea water levels, though only to a small degree, writes the British research project for monitoring the Antarctic (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="21">According to information from the AWI, the Larsen C ice shelf, at almost 50,000 square metres, is the fourth biggest ice shelf in Antarctica.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is up to 700 metres thick where it meets the mainland, and around 200 metres at the front edge to the open ocean.</seg>
<seg id="23">It regularly breaks off there.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Although this is a natural event, and we’re not aware of any direct link to climate change, this puts the ice sheet in a very vulnerable position," says Martin O'Leary from Britain's Swansea University.</seg>
<seg id="25">"This is the furthest back that it has been since records began," he also confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="26">There is disagreement among scientists as to whether the Larsen C ice shelf will now grow again or whether it is receding long term and possibly collapsing, said his colleague Adrian Luckman, adding: "Our models say it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="27">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if these researchers do not attribute the break-off of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, nevertheless, very many ice shelfs in the Antarctic Peninsula have crumbled in recent decades.</seg>
<seg id="29">This long tail of Antarctica stretches towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="30">According to data from the research programme the British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface area of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="31">The rise in temperatures has contributed to this decline.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed up by around three degrees in the last 50 years and is amongst those areas where temperatures are rising most quickly.</seg>

<seg id="1">CDU want in-house wage agreement for staff</seg>
<seg id="2">Since it is getter ever more difficult to fill the positions that become available, the CDU is calling for secession from the employers' association, so as to become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="3">Shortly before the Summer recess, the district assembly rubber-stamped 41 new posts in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="4">More than 1100 permanent staff members and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="5">Now another 17 trainees once more have their first working day behind them.</seg>
<seg id="6">The apprenticeship positions at the district are apparently very coveted.</seg>
<seg id="7">There were around 620 applications recorded for the places on offer this year.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, the district is lacking additional personnel which it needs to overcome growing demands and duties.</seg>
<seg id="9">Currently there are 50 positions at the district of Mettmann that are still unfilled.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sought after are, among others, doctors and engineers as well as general administrative staff.</seg>
<seg id="11">The CDU, together with the FDP and the UWG, now wants to seize the initiative in the district assembly and counter the dearth of skilled workers in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="12">The administration is to "work out a plan for acquiring and developing staff," in line with the wishes of the parties.</seg>
<seg id="13">The plan is not only to satisfy short-term demand in skilled workers, but, with a view to the future, to counteract the shortage of applicants, it is reported.</seg>
<seg id="14">The entire concept should focus internally and externally, demonstrate concrete measures for lateral entry employees, and include a training offensive, demand the CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="15">Well that does sound like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="16">For the district has staffing problems, the likes of which it has not seen before.</seg>
<seg id="17">Other cities poach good officials and staff members and offer attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="18">The talk is of a downright "contest between public employers".</seg>
<seg id="19">In addition, a large number of employees are leaving service due to illness or age.</seg>
<seg id="20">High time to act then, so that not even more positions remain unfilled.</seg>
<seg id="21">Yet Klaus-Dieter Völker, parliamentary group leader of the CDU, is, with his party, going even beyond the joint request.</seg>
<seg id="22">Just recently he caused a huge surprise in the district assembly when he publicly called the staff capping into question and startled the other parties.</seg>
<seg id="23">Völker wants all avenues to be examined that enable a secession from the municipal employers' association.</seg>
<seg id="24">"If we don't reach a satisfactory solution in the short term, the district administration should strive with the unions – perhaps also in collaboration with the district's towns – to secure an in-house wage agreement," said Völker.</seg>
<seg id="25">The CDU are thereby attempting to pay the permanent staff and officials better than the pay-scale for public sector workers actually allows for.</seg>
<seg id="26">Salaries are currently prescribed exactly, and there are only raises or more money when moves into a more senior level, which is based on years experience.</seg>
<seg id="27">Yet the district's tasks have expanded more and more in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="28">For the first time a few weeks ago, new premises had to be erected for staff to tackle the provisions of the new Prostitutes Protection Act.</seg>
<seg id="29">Not least because of the growing number of applications for asylum, County Commissioner Thomas Hendele and District Director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too few staff.</seg>

<seg id="1">Italy toughens tone on NGO migrant rescue boats</seg>
<seg id="2">Italy has warned NGOs operating migrant rescue boats in the Mediterranean they will not be allowed to continue if they do not sign up to new rules governing their operations.</seg>
<seg id="3">"If NGOs do not sign up to a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue operating," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with Turin daily La Stampa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities impounded a boat operated by German aid organisatiion Jugend Rettet on suspicion its crew effectively collaborated with people traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="5">The aid organisation, which has only been operational for a year, declined to comment on the substance of detailed allegations made against it by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.</seg>
<seg id="6">"For us the rescue of human life is and will be our top priority, so we are very sorry we will not be able to operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," the organisation said in a statement on social media.</seg>
<seg id="7">"We can only assess all the accusations currently being made after we have gathered all the information and can assess the situation."</seg>
<seg id="8">Italian authorities had been monitoring Jugend Rettet's boat, the Iuventa, since October.</seg>
<seg id="9">Its crew is suspected to taking on board dinghy loads of migrants delivered directly to them by people traffickers and allowing the smugglers to make off with the vessels to be used again.</seg>
<seg id="10">At least one such meeting allegedly took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file, the contents of which were published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="11">The crew are suspected of having flouted the authority of the Italian coastguard, which oversees rescue operations in the zone, out of humanitarian zeal rather than for any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="12">Under the code of conduct, boats like the Iuventa would notably have to have an Italian police officer on board monitoring their activities.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code: Save The Children, Malta-based MOAS and Spain's Pro-Activa Open Arms.</seg>
<seg id="14">The latter said on Thursday it regarded the new rules as unnecessary but acceptable as they would not involve any "significant change or impediment" to its rescue operations.</seg>
<seg id="15">Among those who have refused to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning organisation Doctors Without Borders (MSF).</seg>
<seg id="16">Minniti meanwhile said a sharp fall over recent weeks in the number of migrants arriving in Italy following rescues was an indication that efforts to beef up the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors was bearing fruit.</seg>
<seg id="17">"In recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.</seg>
<seg id="18">He revealed plans for further talks this month with Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.</seg>

<seg id="1">Ascents and trials</seg>
<seg id="2">Nine Weilermer Bikers, the "Berlin outpost", and two guest riders met in Wachenheim in North Palatinate to enjoy four days of trials and attractions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Three chummy guides were on hand for this.</seg>
<seg id="4">The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Tal proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="5">Wachenheim's Castle and Wine Festival was a welcome extra.</seg>
<seg id="6">The first tour led along the vineyards, amidst hot summer temperatures, to the Chapel of St. Michael above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="7">There followed viewing spots, some on towers, from which one could look far and wide over the Palatinate Forest and the upstream plains.</seg>
<seg id="8">In between, there were time and again long uphill climbs, for which long trials were the reward.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the second day, they went to Bad Dürkheim, to the salt works and to the Wurstmarkt festival.</seg>
<seg id="10">Again, there came vantage point after vantage point, strung together with "flowing" trials and moderate ascents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On the last two days, lots of high altitudes were on the cards again.</seg>
<seg id="12">Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and refreshment cabins brought welcome pauses.</seg>
<seg id="13">In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers breathed in healing salt water in the open-air inhalatorium.</seg>
<seg id="14">They headed for Neustadt too.</seg>
<seg id="15">After 173 kilometres and almost 4500 metres in altitude, the group had got to know the Palatinate Forest from its best side – sporty and cultural.</seg>

<seg id="1">Console instead of turf – Bundesliga is getting ready for e-sport</seg>
<seg id="2">Will the sports stars of the future sit in front of computer consoles instead of battling sweatily, come wind or rain, on the stadium turf?</seg>
<seg id="3">The fact is, e-sport has long been a credible industry, a lucrative business – big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments, complete with big salaries.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even the top Bundesliga clubs have recognised this, and are getting more and more involved in this area.</seg>
<seg id="5">VfL Wolfsburg took the lead in 2015, followed later by FC Schalke 04, and most recently by VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sport department in the middle of July and signed two pros for the computer game FIFA 17.</seg>
<seg id="6">"By doing this, we hope to get completely new, young target groups fired up about the VfB,“ says board member Jochen Röttgermann.</seg>
<seg id="7">He is sure "that countless more clubs are getting on board this train."</seg>
<seg id="8">The world football association, FIFA, is organising the first "Interactive Club World Cup" this coming weekend in London, which will see gamers from different clubs compete against each other.</seg>
<seg id="9">Alongside Schalke and Wolfsburg, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain and PSV Eindhoven have qualified, to give some examples.</seg>
<seg id="10">Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="11">The ex-coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen is now consulting an agency for virtual footballers.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Real football has to deal in particular with the 14-30 year olds, so that the young people still go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="13">And: the clubs are trying to conquer all possible markets, above all the Asian ones.</seg>
<seg id="14">With prominent e-sportspeople under contract, it would be possible to be present online in these markets vastly more often than the mere once a year the national team gets sent to Asia.</seg>
<seg id="15">What exactly is it about?</seg>
<seg id="16">In e-sport, computer games like "League Of Legends", "Dota 2", "Counterstrike" or even the football simulator FIFA are battled out on a competitive level.</seg>
<seg id="17">Just like in the regular sport, leagues have long been established, in which the pros compete against one another.</seg>
<seg id="18">And for the 2022 Asian Games, e-sport is already part of the official programme.</seg>
<seg id="19">But is it even a real sport?</seg>
<seg id="20">For many people, this notion certainly takes some getting used to.</seg>
<seg id="21">Ingo Froböse also grappled with this question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="22">For the professor at the German Sports University of Cologne, e-sport is a sport, because it is competitive and features many biological and physical reactions that one also finds in classic sport – for example, a raised heart rate, stress responses, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="23">In addition, it requires cognitive capabilities, technical and tactical understanding and an ability to react quickly.</seg>
<seg id="24">Professional gamers ought to train not only on the console, but also their bodies, and should pay attention to their diet.</seg>
<seg id="25">"A fit player is a good player."</seg>
<seg id="26">Froböse sees problems too though: "Doping is becoming more and more of an issue".</seg>
<seg id="27">For online games it is difficult to implement testing, and the scene is lacking the structures of the classic sport.</seg>
<seg id="28">The scientist positively stresses the highly integrative effect of e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="29">The players travel internationally, it is like a big global family, and there are no intercultural barriers.</seg>
<seg id="30">A study from consultancy firm Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth for the e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="31">In 2016, it turned over 50 million euros in Germany, many through advertising, sponsorship and big tournaments.</seg>
<seg id="32">In three years, the turnover should total 130 million.</seg>
<seg id="33">Compared to the almost 2.4 billion euros of the football Bundesliga that is admittedly scant.</seg>
<seg id="34">However, the e-sport is "no longer far off other established sports like handball, basketball or ice hockey," write the Deloitte consultants.</seg>
<seg id="35">Many countries internationally are already further ahead.</seg>
<seg id="36">Big markets are Asia and the USA, where ex-basketball player Shaquille O`Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez are involved in the US team NRG eSports.</seg>
<seg id="37">Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher is investing in the e-sport bookmaker Unikrn.</seg>
<seg id="38">In Europe too, quite a bit is happening.</seg>
<seg id="39">E-sport has been introduced to the curriculum in a Norwegian school, says Froböse.</seg>
<seg id="40">In the Netherlands and in France, the top division football clubs are now committed to setting up an e-sport department, according to Dutt.</seg>
<seg id="41">"Compared with the rest of Europe, Germany is lagging behind," declares VfB board member, Röttgermann.</seg>
<seg id="42">Simply to slide back into nostalgia and romanticise the old days is no longer enough these days.</seg>
<seg id="43">It's about preserving the tradition of the club while at the same time aligning the business with the modern market.</seg>
<seg id="44">"We are living in a digitalised world," says Dutt as well.</seg>
<seg id="45">"So you can't cling on to the idea that only in football, everything stays as it always was."</seg>

<seg id="1">Michelle Carter sentenced for texts urging suicide of Conrad Roy</seg>
<seg id="2">A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through texts and phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="3">Michelle Carter, now 20, will serve 15 months of her term behind bars and five years of probation.</seg>
<seg id="4">Carter was convicted in June of the involuntary manslaughter of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on 13 July 2014.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mr Roy's father told Thursday's hearing: "My family is heartbroken.</seg>
<seg id="6">My son was my best friend."</seg>
<seg id="7">Carter was allowed to remain free pending an appeal.</seg>
<seg id="8">She had faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal team argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from mental illness.</seg>
<seg id="9">Dressed in red trousers and a cream blouse, Carter stood tearfully with hands clasped and eyes cast down as she was sentenced.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Her actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.</seg>
<seg id="11">"She ended his life to better her own.</seg>
<seg id="12">She has not accepted responsibility," she said.</seg>
<seg id="13">"She has shown no remorse."</seg>
<seg id="14">But Carter's lawyer said it was a "horrible circumstance that she completely regrets."</seg>
<seg id="15">However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not find that her "age or level of maturity or even her mental illness have any significant impact on her actions."</seg>
<seg id="16">A prosecutor read a statement from Mr Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, saying there was "not one day I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son.</seg>
<seg id="17">I want him to be proud of me and how I am handling everything - I am trying to be there for his sisters in all of my pain we will carry with us for eternity," it said.</seg>
<seg id="18">Mr Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was "haunted" by the realisation that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt to his children.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Not having that one person I've been with every day since birth is a pain I'll always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.</seg>
<seg id="20">The case appears to set a legal precedent, as there is no Massachusetts law that criminalises telling a person to commit suicide.</seg>
<seg id="21">Carter was 17 when Mr Roy was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="22">The case drew national attention after Carter's text messages revealed she had encouraged him to end his life.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Hang yourself, jump off a building, stab yourself I don't know there's a lot of ways," she said in several messages sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family.</seg>
<seg id="24">In the moments before his suicide, she wrote: "You need to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn the generator on and you will be free and happy."</seg>
<seg id="25">Judge Moniz said Carter sought attention through Mr Roy's death, ordering that she not be allowed to profit from the case through any press.</seg>
<seg id="26">The case has divided legal opinion.</seg>
<seg id="27">Among the few to defend Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007 before she was cleared two years ago.</seg>
<seg id="28">Ms Knox, 30, published an op-ed in the Los Angeles Times saying: "Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison."</seg>

<seg id="1">Joshua Kimmich: Learning from FC Bayern's new mini Lahm</seg>
<seg id="2">It is no coincidence that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to take to the field as captain at the Audi Cup.</seg>
<seg id="3">FC Bayern thinks the Confederations Cup winner is capable of a big season – a bit of extra motivation doesn't hurt.</seg>
<seg id="4">Something was different there at his place in the dressing room; Joshua Kimmich noticed that immediately, even if the extra piece of kit was very, very small.</seg>
<seg id="5">But since on the second day of the Audi Cup there was of course no Philipp Lahm anywhere to be seen, and no Manuel Neuer either, he simply put the band he'd been allocated on his arm.</seg>
<seg id="6">"The coach didn't announce it", explained the Confederations Cup winner later, after his first outing as Bayern captain.</seg>
<seg id="7">Sure, the debut could have gone better than the 0:2 against SSC Napoli.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Kimmich could also interpret the signal from the coach as follows.</seg>
<seg id="9">Out of the C team of youth players, debutants and pros just back from the holidays, it was not the eight-years-older Arturo Vidal that was chosen as captain, but him.</seg>
<seg id="10">Indeed, it is those that one thinks capable, those who one wants to keep happy that one likes to give treats to the most.</seg>
<seg id="11">And anyone chosen to take on the mantel of Lahm can do only too well with a little bit of extra motivation.</seg>
<seg id="12">Kimmich confirmed: "That is what one wants as a player: to take on responsibility."</seg>
<seg id="13">The 22-year-old darted over the field like a mini Lahm on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="14">Right back, that's his position now; the white armband cast its habitual spell.</seg>
<seg id="15">And in general, Kimmich looked in this starting formation like one who is best able to take to the helm.</seg>
<seg id="16">He gave instructions, attempted to steer the out-of-practice troop.</seg>
<seg id="17">He had an eye for the bigger picture while many others were busied with themselves.</seg>
<seg id="18">Vidal to cover up his lack of fitness (didn't really work); Renato Sanches to live up to his performances of the Asia trip (worked, but to a limited extent); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle to not make a negative impression on their first outings in the Bayern jersey.</seg>
<seg id="19">That worked out quite well though.</seg>
<seg id="20">Süle took to the field alongside Kimmich, Rudy in front of the defence – both performed excellently.</seg>
<seg id="21">The renowned Napoli attack often made heavy weather of it, and on top of that, Süle made a couple of successful attempts as the game developed.</seg>
<seg id="22">His team mate, Rudy, admitted that the result "was not what we had hoped for".</seg>
<seg id="23">But he too showed a decent performance on his debut.</seg>
<seg id="24">Shifting play, changing pace: "That's the style I was brought in for".</seg>
<seg id="25">Just how unused to new arrivals this Bayern world is could be seen after the match.</seg>
<seg id="26">Rudy, for example, gave not one or two, but as many as six or seven interviews in the tunnels.</seg>
<seg id="27">Kimmich took his leave after a few crisp remarks in support of his new team mates.</seg>
<seg id="28">There was an interesting sentence to be heard from Süle there: "I've already noticed what went wrong here.</seg>
<seg id="29">At Bayern, you just have to win every game."</seg>
<seg id="30">He doesn't have to teach the newbies that anymore though.</seg>

<seg id="1">Companies happy with Rhineland-Palatinate minister: Industry praises Wissing's speed</seg>
<seg id="2">The relationship between the state and local industry often proved irreconcilable when Evaline Lemke (The Greens) was still Rhineland Palatinate's Economic Affairs Minister.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is evident after more than a year of the new Economic Affairs Minister, Volker Wissing (FDP) being in office.</seg>
<seg id="4">Chambers and companies from the region are responding to a TV enquiry by speaking of a change in economic policy – and at the same time rebuke the old minister.</seg>
<seg id="5">Frank Natus, chairman of the association of Trier companies Vereinigung Trierer Unternehmen (VTU) says: "Wissing is addressing the wishes of the industry, all of which Lemke blocked."</seg>
<seg id="6">Natus considers the biggest U-turn to be in infrastructure policy: linking the A1 motorway between Kelber and Adenau is now right at the top of the state's list of priorities.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Ministry hopes that planning procedures will be in place this year already, and the construction rights should hold until 2021.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Trier western bypass also plays a role in the state's plans, being in the priority need category of The Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan.</seg>
<seg id="9">The goal is to put the stretch into service in December 2020, says ministry spokesperson Cornelia Holtmann.</seg>
<seg id="10">Natus sees in this a roadmap for supporting regional, but internationally competitive, companies.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Trier Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK) is striving, as spurred on by Wissing, to achieve a Rhineland-Palatinate label for wine, in order to increase sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of the last ten years of sagging German wine exports.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, Wissing is said to have a sympathetic ear for people who want to found their own company, the IHK applauded.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Trier Chamber of Trades sees an additional incentive for young trainees in the new master bonus, says manager Matthias Schwalbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">A prize of 1000 euros is envisaged for passing the master craftsman examination, and 2500 euros if graduates become self-employed within ten years of their master craftsman training.</seg>
<seg id="15">The state's list of homework assignments remains long though.</seg>
<seg id="16">Facts have to presented quickly for the road construction planned, and at the same time the state is lacking the necessary human resources, says Jan Glockauer, Managing Director of the Trier IHK.</seg>
<seg id="17">Of the 56 new engineers that Wissing wants to employ at the Federal State Office for Mobility, only 29 posts have been filled thus far.</seg>
<seg id="18">The IHK is pressing for more contracts to be awarded to external offices.</seg>
<seg id="19">Deputy leader of the CDU parliamentary faction Christian Baldauf points to calculations from the Court of Auditors: in 2017 and 2018, the state is investing more than 20 million euros less on maintaining federal state roads than recommended.</seg>
<seg id="20">Frank Natus is also still expecting the state to put forward a policy as to how it wants to remedy the lack of skilled workers in the region.</seg>
<seg id="21">Also sobering is the expansion of broadband in the state up until now.</seg>
<seg id="22">In 2016, in an IHK survey, local companies had evaluated the mains supply with a mark of only 3.4.</seg>
<seg id="23">They complained about sluggish internet connections and outages.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ex-Minister of Economic Affairs Eveline Lemke, on the other hand, is currently out of politics and is still sitting on the supervisory board of wind energy company Pro Wind.</seg>
<seg id="25">Lemke left the Green party in April in order to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe – from where, after four months, she has already bid a retreat due to disagreements.</seg>

<seg id="2">A day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would offer to upgrade the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="3">The BMW chairman said the company believed "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions," referring to the European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - that have considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="4">Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce their diesel emissions.</seg>
<seg id="5">None of the companies described the moves as recalls.</seg>
<seg id="6">European carmakers have heavily promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help meet rules on carbon dioxide emissions.</seg>
<seg id="7">But the nitrogen oxides that diesel engines emit are considered carcinogens, and can cause asthma.</seg>
<seg id="8">The cost to automotive companies of installing equipment to neutralize the fumes emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive.</seg>
<seg id="9">As German automakers face scrutiny, the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel has also been accused of coddling the powerful car companies and of ignoring signs of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="10">The companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Volkswagen, which covered up its use of so-called defeat devices that could adjust emissions to comply with regulations when a car was being tested, but ease back in normal driving conditions.</seg>
<seg id="11">Several Volkswagen executives have been charged in the United States, and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="12">Last month, the former head of thermodynamics at Audi's engine development department was arrested in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="13">The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian, and therefore is not protected from extradition and could face trial in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="14">Early this year, Audi was swept up into a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system to evade emissions rules in Europe, broadening an inquiry that had focused on the United States.</seg>
<seg id="15">The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen: The luxury carmaker accounts for a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profit.</seg>

<seg id="1">Mordillo's bulbous noses and laughing in the face of sorrow</seg>
<seg id="2">Mordillo was for a while one of the most-published cartoonists; his figures' bulbous noses are his trade mark.</seg>
<seg id="3">Even at 85, the Argentinian still draws and is working on a film.</seg>
<seg id="4">His message: Laughing, "Because there's too much sorrow in the world."</seg>
<seg id="5">Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4th August 1932 in Buenos Aires, the son of a Spanish immigrant.</seg>
<seg id="6">In his first years as an artist he struggled along as an illustrator for celebration cards, amongst other things – which frustrated him.</seg>
<seg id="7">"The happiest day in my professional life was the day I lost my job," he once said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Following posts in Lima, New York and Paris, at the end of the 60s he finally got his breakthrough: when his cartoons were published in "Paris Match" and then in the "Stern" as well, and other leading magazines around the world.</seg>
<seg id="9">Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.</seg>
<seg id="10">The artist always let himself be inspired by cities.</seg>
<seg id="11">Large, rounded Mordillo figures cavort around in his drawings with the leaning tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the early morning, he sits at his drawing desk, still today according to his own statements, and works almost ten hours a day.</seg>
<seg id="13">On calendars, puzzles, books for young and old, t-shirts, soft toys and clocks, his whimsical figures are still disseminated widely around the world.</seg>
<seg id="14">In addition, he has been working for six years on an animated film and a TV series with his figures.</seg>
<seg id="15">The main character in the film "Crazy Island" is a giraffe – Mordillo's favourite animal in his drawings – who has a millipede as his nemesis.</seg>
<seg id="16">His figures are speaking for the first time in the 3D film, which should hit cinema screens in 2019.</seg>
<seg id="17">“I don’t know exactly what they are going to say; it is odd for me," says Mordillo.</seg>
<seg id="18">The screenplay was not written by him.</seg>
<seg id="19">Therefore he is focussing rather on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is being produced without words.</seg>

<seg id="1">Provence lavender under threat from climate change</seg>
<seg id="2">It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it's under threat from climate change.</seg>
<seg id="3">Lavender is in decline because of drought-like conditions and disease-carrying insects, causing a major headache for scientists and farmers attempting to find solutions.</seg>
<seg id="4">Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Provence-based agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM, said: "Lavender in Provence is effectively endangered, because in recent years the plant has been subjected to the effects of climate change that brought a lot less rain in the spring and mostly in the autumn.</seg>
<seg id="5">This affects the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="6">There's also a small cicada, a micro-bacteria transmitting leaf hopper, and in very dry weather there are lots of them."</seg>
<seg id="7">And a lot is at stake.</seg>
<seg id="8">As well as attracting holidaymakers, lavender oil is highly sought after for perfume and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long plant ears with a number of large flowers, we have smaller ones, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.</seg>
<seg id="10">So we have fewer parts with essential oil."</seg>
<seg id="11">Solutions being looked at include better water distribution and slowing down evaporation from the soil, but also spraying the plants with a protective mix of clay and water and developing varieties more resistant to dry conditions.</seg>

<seg id="1">A journalist's murder underscores growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="2">The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce normally meets on Wednesdays to review their plans for coverage of the most recent mayhem wrought in Sinaloa state by organized crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="3">But on this day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they've come together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="4">It's important to change their routines, they are told.</seg>
<seg id="5">Two senior journalists discuss what feels safer: to take their children with them to the office, which was the target of a grenade attack in 2009, or to leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="6">Security experts have written three words on a blackboard at the front of the room: adversaries, neutrals, allies.</seg>
<seg id="7">They ask the reporters to suggest names for each column - no proof is needed, perceptions and gut feelings are enough.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are drug-traffickers, politicians, businesspeople, journalists suspected of being on the payroll of the government or the cartels, a catalog of villains who make the job of covering Mexico's chaos perilous.</seg>
<seg id="9">There is no respite from the violence, and as bodies pile up across the country, more and more of them are journalists: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists; 589 under federal protection after attacks and threats; and so far this year, at least seven dead in seven states.</seg>
<seg id="10">Among the latest is their editor and inspiration, Riodoce co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The greatest error is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on narco-violence.</seg>
<seg id="12">His absence is felt deeply, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez displaying his middle finger, with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building; two reporters on their 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts that display his smiling, bespectacled face or his trademark Panama hat.</seg>
<seg id="13">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death; the reporters discuss their shared trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although a special federal prosecutor's office was established in 2010 to handle the journalists' cases, it has only prosecuted two, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="15">As with most of the thousands of murders tied to drug trafficking and organized crime each year, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.</seg>
<seg id="16">At Riodoce, they persist in covering the violence of Sinaloa, though they are heartbroken, though the terrain is more treacherous now.</seg>
<seg id="17">Without information on the killers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security, says Ibarra, is of little use.</seg>
<seg id="18">"It's very foolish to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="19">"As long as we don't know why, you distrust everyone."</seg>
<seg id="20">On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Riodoce office in the state capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="21">He managed to drive just a couple blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men; he was forced out of his car and shot 12 times, presumably for the name of the paper - which translates as Twelfth River.</seg>
<seg id="22">The gunman drove away in his car and crashed it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="24">He left a wife and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="25">Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="26">But on the subject of Valdez, there's practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="27">Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the country's bloodiest battlegrounds as rival factions fight to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="28">Never mind that someone or several people are shot dead in the street every day in Sinaloa, or that the cemetery is filled with ornate, two-story mausoleums for drug kings, larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="29">Forget for a minute that a state of "calm" is when just one cartel is in control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug-trafficking routes to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="30">Despite that, and the fact that Valdez was intimately aware of the perils of his work, Ismail Bojorquez, 60, a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is wracked with guilt for failing to protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="31">He believes two errors contributed to the killing.</seg>
<seg id="32">First there was the publication in February of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions at war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="33">The piece may have angered the sons; suspected gang members bought up every copy of the edition as soon as they were delivered to newsstands.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second mistake was not forcing Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of another newspaper that carried the same story.</seg>
<seg id="35">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="36">He'd survived for so long, his friends and colleagues assumed he'd always be there.</seg>
<seg id="37">He was a veteran reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues in creating Riodoce, selling $50 shares.</seg>
<seg id="38">In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without touching the narco issue," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="39">Over time the paper earned a reputation for brave and honest coverage, and sales and advertising increased.</seg>
<seg id="40">Reporters loved being able to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories nobody else dared to cover.</seg>
<seg id="41">Eight years after Riodoce was founded, it won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot award for coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="42">That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to Protect Journalists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug story wherever it led.</seg>
<seg id="43">He freely acknowledged that he was frightened.</seg>
<seg id="44">"I want to carry on living," he said at the time of the CPJ award.</seg>
<seg id="45">Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October, in an interview with Rompeviento TV.</seg>
<seg id="46">"You have to assume the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play dumb.</seg>
<seg id="47">I don't want to be asked, 'What were you doing in the face of so much death ... why didn't you say what was going on?'"</seg>
<seg id="48">The Riodoce staff misses Valdez, the jokester who swore like a longshoreman, the friend generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="49">They relied on his routine.</seg>
<seg id="50">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="51">He would go to El Guayabo, the bar across from the office, and would always sit at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="52">Now, they ask: Was his love of routine his downfall?</seg>
<seg id="53">His death also has forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their jobs and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="54">"They don't like it if you mess with their women, their children, their clean businesses, their clandestine airstrips" used to move drugs.</seg>
<seg id="55">"Those things were off-limits," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="56">The result is, even in the best of times, a high-level of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="57">Trusting one's instincts.</seg>
<seg id="58">If it smells wrong, stay away.</seg>
<seg id="59">The trouble, said Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal, is that "smell is a sense that can be fooled ... and then the thing with Javier happened."</seg>
<seg id="60">The old rules, he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as they don't in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials.</seg>
<seg id="61">The landscape constantly shifts.</seg>
<seg id="62">In the room where Riodoce staff met for security training, suddenly no cellphones were allowed; days before, it was revealed that spyware sold exclusively to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="63">Outside, two police officers sought relief from the 104-degree (40 Celsius) heat in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="64">They were assigned by the state government to guard Riodoce's offices, housed in a four-story building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="65">Half-jokingly, some of the reporters wondered whether these officers are among the 50 percent of cops whom the governor himself has said are not trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="66">It has been months since the reporters have gone into the mountainous countryside, where the drug gangs are in de facto control.</seg>
<seg id="67">For this week's edition Riodoce was looking at three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="68">There was the killing of former boxing great Julio Cesar Chavez's brother in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="69">They also had an expose on government spending concentrated in the governor's hometown.</seg>
<seg id="70">And there was a group kidnapping in one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, a block from the prosecutor's office.</seg>
<seg id="71">There was no official word on who was abducted or how it happened, so caution set in when it came time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite of both drug traffickers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="72">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party, or PRI, which dominated all levels of politics for nearly all of the last century.</seg>
<seg id="73">Recently several PRI governors have been accused of corruption in high-profile cases.</seg>
<seg id="74">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about prior incidents in that locale, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military raid.</seg>
<seg id="75">Just months before, readers would have looked to Valdez's column for the best-sourced information about the kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="76">"Before, we would have already known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" for his slender build.</seg>
<seg id="77">"Now all channels of communication with our sources have been broken."</seg>
<seg id="78">Valdez's office has been repurposed as a storage room for signs and stickers protesting journalist killings, as staff have become something they never expected to be: activists on behalf of the press.</seg>
<seg id="79">Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few of the signs and headed out the next morning for a demonstration at the local prosecutor's office over yet another journalist.</seg>
<seg id="80">Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez was killed.</seg>
<seg id="81">A burned body has been discovered and officials say it is his, based on DNA tests.</seg>
<seg id="82">Nationwide, journalists have become more vocal, scrawling "SOS Press" on sidewalks and buildings in organized protests.</seg>
<seg id="83">On this day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington, trying to rally international support for justice in the Valdez case.</seg>
<seg id="84">At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez was killed, Ramirez accused authorities of spying on journalists and having them killed for telling the truth.</seg>
<seg id="85">She has since asked to be reassigned from covering the government, concerned that her anger has hurt her objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="86">Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are "surrounded" by organized crime, complicit government officials and an indifferent society.</seg>
<seg id="87">In his last book, "Narco-journalism," he wrote that reporters are being killed not just by drug gangs but on the order of politicians and security forces in cahoots with organized crime.</seg>
<seg id="88">The media watchdog group Articulo 19 attributed more than half of attacks on journalists last year to police and public officials.</seg>
<seg id="89">"In Mexico you die because they want to shut you up," Ramirez said.</seg>
<seg id="90">Clearly, the murders have a chilling effect.</seg>
<seg id="91">No one forgets the death six years ago of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.</seg>
<seg id="92">Her body was found along with a note purportedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "Here I am because of my reports."</seg>
<seg id="93">A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to her severed head.</seg>
<seg id="94">Some outlets have opted to close, such as the newspaper El Norte, in the northern border state of Chihuahua, after the killing of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="95">Others keep going, as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did following the killing of its director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="96">In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed the drug cartels publicly with a front-page editorial titled, "What do you want from us?"</seg>
<seg id="97">Some journalists have fled their home states or even the country.</seg>
<seg id="98">It's a wrenching decision.</seg>
<seg id="99">It's hard to find work in exile, and they still scan the streets, looking for danger.</seg>
<seg id="100">And sometimes, they are hunted down, as apparently was photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in a Mexico City apartment three months after fleeing Veracruz.</seg>
<seg id="101">For those who stay behind and continue the work, it's a daily dance of high-risk decisions.</seg>
<seg id="102">Ibarra - who once wanted to be a poet - admits that covering the drug trade scares him.</seg>
<seg id="103">"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.</seg>
<seg id="104">At midnight on a recent Friday, with the latest issue already put to bed, Riodoce editors sat on the sidewalk outside the office, drinking beer, when all at once, their phones began to buzz.</seg>
<seg id="105">A series of shootouts involving gang rivals and security forces near the beach resort city of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.</seg>
<seg id="106">The war continued to escalate, as was promised by a series of cartel messages discovered in the area.</seg>
<seg id="107">From the curb, via cellphone, they put the news up on Riodoce's website.</seg>
<seg id="108">The front page would have to be changed the next day.</seg>
<seg id="109">Sirens wailed nearby - another shootout in the area.</seg>
<seg id="110">Bojorquez glanced over at the police officers standing guard to see if they were alert.</seg>
<seg id="111">If they were at all afraid, they didn't show it.</seg>
<seg id="112">Beneath the massive portrait of their newspaper's fallen founder, his middle finger displayed for all of Sinaloa to see, the staff of Riodoce was following in his footsteps.</seg>
<seg id="113">"How can you even think of closing," Bojorquez said, "when the same day Javier was killed the intern asked me to send her out to report on the street?"</seg>

<seg id="1">Dinosaur used camouflage to evade its enemies</seg>
<seg id="2">At first glance, it looks like a statue albeit a terrifying one.</seg>
<seg id="3">Now researchers have revealed the first findings from the incredible rhino-sized creature found by a Canadian miner were so well preserved experts have described it as 'the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs'.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was so well preserved, they were even able to determine the colour of its scaly skin was a reddish brown - and say it had something of a 'troubled past'.</seg>
<seg id="5">The report in the journal Current Biology described it as 'the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world.'</seg>
<seg id="6">The fossil is a newfound species of nodosaur, which lived midway through the Cretaceous period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="7">It's incredible well preserved state has stunned researchers, who describe it as 'truly remarkable'</seg>
<seg id="8">The armoured plant-eater is the best preserved fossil of its kind ever found, according to reports in National Geographic.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was found by Shawn Funk, when he was digging at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.</seg>
<seg id="10">He hit something which seemed out of place from the surrounding rock, and decided to take a closer look.</seg>
<seg id="11">The fossil he uncovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="12">They spent the next six years working on uncovering the beast within the 2,500-pound (1,100 kg) lump of earth.</seg>
<seg id="13">After all that hard work, the finished result is now ready to be unveiled.</seg>
<seg id="14">'If you just squint your eyes a bit, you could almost believe it was sleeping,' said lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is on display.</seg>
<seg id="15">'It will go down in science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.'</seg>
<seg id="16">By studying its skin, researchers found that this plant-eater, though covered in armor and resembling a walking tank, likely faced a significant threat from meat-eating dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="17">The heavily armoured dinosaur used red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and employed a shielding technique known as counter-shading, which is also used by many modern-day animals.</seg>
<seg id="18">This would have allowed it to better blend into its surroundings and evade its enemies, experts say, suggesting it was preyed on by larger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="19">The 110-million-year-old creature, part of the nodosaur family, first hit headlines in May and is now on view at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="20">Researchers have now studied and named the beast Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team who spent more than 7,000 hours painstakingly uncovering it.</seg>
<seg id="21">The amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible for Dr Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armour across its body.</seg>
<seg id="22">They discovered countershading, a common method of defence in the animal kingdom, which means the top of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="23">Although countershading is common, the findings come as surprise because Borealopelta's size far exceeds that of countershaded animals alive today.</seg>
<seg id="24">It suggests the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure meat-eating dinosaurs that evolution favoured concealment over confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="25">But most contemporary animals that have countershading -- think deer, zebras or armadillos -- are much smaller and more vulnerable as prey, signaling that this nodosaur faced a real struggle to survive.</seg>
<seg id="26">'Strong predation on a massive, heavily-armored dinosaur illustrates just how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous must have been,' said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="27">Chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales also reveal that the dinosaur's skin would have been reddish brown.</seg>
<seg id="28">Scientists are continuing to study the animal for clues about its life, including its preserved gut contents to find out what it ate for its last meal.</seg>
<seg id="29">They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into a river and was swept out to sea, where it sank on its back to the ocean floor.</seg>
<seg id="30">At that time, Alberta was as warm as south Florida is today, and rivers and oceans likely spread far further inland than they do now.</seg>
<seg id="31">'This nodosaur is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered in preserved scaly skin, yet is also preserved in three dimensions, retaining the original shape of the animal,' said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="32">'The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it did back in the Early Cretaceous.</seg>
<seg id="33">You don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it; if you just squint your eyes a bit, you could almost believe it was sleeping.'</seg>
<seg id="34">The Cretaceous was a time when giant theropods, meat-eating dinosaurs that stood on two legs, roamed the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="35">Although the king of them all, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaur may have been hunted by some of its formidable ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="36">They include Acrocanthosaurus, a 38ft (11.5m) long monster weighing six tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="37">The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe Borealopelta was washed out to sea after it died and mummified in mud.</seg>
<seg id="38">The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was digging at the Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.</seg>
<seg id="39">According to the museum, it is the best preserved armoured dinosaur in the world, including skin and armour, and is complete from the snout to hips.</seg>
<seg id="40">The creatures were around 18 feet (five metres) long on average, and weighted up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="41">It featured two 20-inch-long spikes which protruded from its shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="42">The researchers believe that the this armored plant-eater lumbered through what is now western Canada, until a flooded river swept it into open sea.</seg>
<seg id="43">But the dinosaur's undersea burial preserved its armor in exquisite detail.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the storm: pile-up on the A8: four injured</seg>
<seg id="2">Serious accident on Thursday evening on the A8: just shy of 30 vehicles were caught up in a mass collision.</seg>
<seg id="3">There are numerous people injured, kilometre-long queues – and rubberneckers.</seg>
<seg id="4">On the motorway between Stuttgart and Munich (A8), around 20 people were injured late on Thursday afternoon in a mass collision.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to initial police information, just shy of 30 vehicles, among which were probably also lorries, had crashed into each other during a storm at around 5pm between the Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen junctions (in the rural district of Aichach-Friedberg).</seg>
<seg id="6">No information is initially available about the precise number of injured people.</seg>
<seg id="7">There are mild to moderate injuries, said a police spokesperson.</seg>
<seg id="8">There was a big squad of rescue vehicles at the scene of the accident.</seg>
<seg id="9">The A8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="10">A roughly 10-km long tailback formed in the direction travelling towards Munich.</seg>
<seg id="11">As an AZ journalist reports, there were massive disruptions in the opposite lane as well – due to numerous rubberneckers.</seg>
<seg id="12">The fire brigade noted down the registration numbers of the drivers, who are now expecting severe penalties.</seg>
<seg id="13">Shortly after 6.45pm, there was then a second accident on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.</seg>
<seg id="14">A collision between a car transporter and a passenger car had occurred.</seg>
<seg id="15">A rescue helicopter was underway to the scene of the accident.</seg>

<seg id="1">Deutsche Bahn: Company trials "comfort check-in"</seg>
<seg id="2">It is a moment that practically everyone has experienced at one time or another: without expecting it, you're sitting in the train asleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">Or one is buried deep in one's work and has just had a genius idea.</seg>
<seg id="4">And then: bang.</seg>
<seg id="5">The conductor comes and rudely awakens you, or tears the passenger from the midst of his workflow.</seg>
<seg id="6">Ticket inspection.</seg>
<seg id="7">But the days of being interrupted will soon be over.</seg>
<seg id="8">Deutsche Bahn is currently trialling conductorless ticket inspection.</seg>
<seg id="9">One simply uses one's mobile to confirm that one has taken one's seat, thereby validating the ticket.</seg>
<seg id="10">Trial operations are currently running on two lines.</seg>
<seg id="11">"If the service is well-received, we'll extend it.</seg>
<seg id="12">It will then probably be available at the beginning of next year on many additional long-distance lines across Germany," said a spokesperson for the railway.</seg>
<seg id="13">The railway is calling this conductorless ticket validation "Comfort Check-in".</seg>
<seg id="14">In order to use it, however, a few conditions must be met: you need a smartphone or a tablet.</seg>
<seg id="15">And you have to have booked an online ticket – which most passengers do already anyway.</seg>
<seg id="16">In addition, you have to have bought it over the Railway's app, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way to book a ticket in any case.</seg>
<seg id="17">And lastly, you need a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="18">For "Comfort Check-in" works like this: you get on board the train and call up your ticket in "My Tickets".</seg>
<seg id="19">The trial customers will then see a button for electronic validation.</seg>
<seg id="20">The train attendants receive a notification on their mobile device saying that passenger X is onboard the train and has occupied booked seat Y.</seg>
<seg id="21">If the train attendant comes to seat Y during ticket inspection, he knows that there is a passenger there with an already validated online ticket.</seg>
<seg id="22">So you can carry on sleeping, working, doing nothing.</seg>
<seg id="23">The "Check-in" has two advantages: one for customers, and one for the railway – which, in turn, should benefit passengers.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Anyone who wants to travel in a relaxed fashion, without having his/her ticket inspected by our on-train staff, simply checks in him/herself in the DB Navigator.</seg>
<seg id="25">This allows passengers to personalise their journey time in the train," says Michael Peterson, Director of Marketing at DB Fernverkehr.</seg>
<seg id="26">A second plus: "And our employees will have more time than they currently do to see to the needs of individual customers".</seg>
<seg id="27">Anyone who travels by train a lot knows that, alongside delays and missing your train, ticket inspection is one of the biggest annoyances.</seg>
<seg id="28">For often you yourself, or, in any case, one of your fellow passengers, doesn't have all the documentation on them that one needs to validate an online ticket.</seg>
<seg id="29">Either the credit card is missing, or the ID card, or some other document that one needs to show.</seg>
<seg id="30">The result is endless discussions between the train attendant and passenger, which leads to a bad atmosphere in the compartment or wider area and delays in one's own ticket getting checked, and ultimately it takes away the conductor's time to see to other matters.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only a small number of trial customers can use the new service as of yet.</seg>
<seg id="32">And only on the connections ICE 915, between Dortmund and Stuttgart, and ICE 912, between Stuttgart and Essen.</seg>
<seg id="33">Other train numbers on the same line have not yet been enabled.</seg>

<seg id="1">How one activist came to learn the answer to the question: 'Whose Streets?'</seg>
<seg id="2">On Aug. 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core.</seg>
<seg id="3">Just a day after arriving in New York City on a trip, the St. Louis native sat on the bed of an Airbnb she was renting, scrolling through Facebook on her phone.</seg>
<seg id="4">She stumbled upon a post from someone from high school.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The police just killed an 18 year old kid and he's still laying in the street," it read.</seg>
<seg id="6">Confused, noticing no one else on her feed had posted the information, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="7">A user with the handle @TheePharoah was being constantly retweeted onto her timeline.</seg>
<seg id="8">The St. Louis-area rapper was live-tweeting the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.</seg>
<seg id="9">He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body stretched out in the street, where it would stay for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="10">"This is wild," Ferrell thought to herself.</seg>
<seg id="11">But death was nothing new for her and her community.</seg>
<seg id="12">She put down her phone only to return later that evening to tweets about people gathering on Canfield Drive.</seg>
<seg id="13">There were photos of police tape and people yelling, and of a guy claiming to be Brown's father holding a sign that read, "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="14">She watched a live feed where a police officer stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="15">In another video, a different cop, she said, cocked his rifle and screamed, "I'll kill all you ... animals."</seg>
<seg id="16">"'This is not usual,'" Ferrell recalled saying.</seg>
<seg id="17">"'This isn't the type of murder that we've become used to and can call typical.'</seg>
<seg id="18">In that moment I felt chills.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was angry and crying."</seg>
<seg id="20">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="21">After landing at 11 p.m., she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her dad's house and decided the two of them would head to Ferguson the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="22">What happened, to Ferrell and to Ferguson in the following almost three years is the subject of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?," in theaters Aug. 11.</seg>
<seg id="23">It's a tale of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience from the vantage point of the people who live in the community and packed the streets demanding answers.</seg>
<seg id="24">As Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter, who was wearing a floral dress and matching crown, the two revisited a conversation they'd had countless times before that morning "about the black experience and black condition."</seg>
<seg id="25">"You remember how I taught you about when black people had to fight for what they believed in?" she recalled saying.</seg>
<seg id="26">"We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and it wasn't right.</seg>
<seg id="27">I couldn't not take her," Ferrell said later.</seg>
<seg id="28">"This happening today is a culmination of ... that has happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="29">She needs to know it and see it and be raised in it.</seg>
<seg id="30">She needs to be well developed in the area of not just activism and organizing but knowing the different layers of the black experience and the black condition and what we must do to get free, to free ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="31">Even if I'm fortunate enough to provide her an experience where she doesn't personally experience blatant racism, she is no different than the next black woman-child.</seg>
<seg id="32">I feel like I would be doing her a disservice to shield her from that."</seg>
<seg id="33">The first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a site across from the police department that became a campground of sorts as the activists awaited word of Officer Darren Wilson's eventual non-indictment.</seg>
<seg id="34">There Ferrell and her daughter linked up with a local business owner who was making sack lunches.</seg>
<seg id="35">They prepared bags and helped pass them out to protesters.</seg>
<seg id="36">Slowly, a new type of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="37">"My activism completely transformed after Aug. 9," she said, noting that while an undergrad at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Assn. and focused on food justice and health disparities in black communities.</seg>
<seg id="38">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="39">It all just came."</seg>
<seg id="40">Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors, during an evening demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="41">Folayan said she and her director of photography Lucas Alvarado-Farrar "just wanted to document" what was happening.</seg>
<seg id="42">A question came to Ferrell's mind: "Do you want to document or are you trying to find a story that you can exploit?"</seg>
<seg id="43">That skepticism was informed by countless instances of people - often white - coming into a community to profit off its pain and resilience.</seg>
<seg id="44">As Folayan explained in a recent interview, "We had heard that people who are born and raised in Ferguson were not having their voices centered, and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="45">Folayan had already linked up with co-director Damon Davis, an area artist known for his activism around death row inmates.</seg>
<seg id="46">His involvement endeared Ferrell to the project, along with six other locals the "Whose Streets?" team followed in the years after Brown's shooting.</seg>
<seg id="47">"This documentary is not somebody speaking for us or speaking to us, it's us speaking," Davis said.</seg>
<seg id="48">"That was the main thing for me, how these people will be represented, because that's how I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="49">While the goal wasn't to focus on Ferrell's experience - in an effort to show that the movement is "not about a messiah leader but a community coming together," Folayan said - she proved to be the most open of the film's participants.</seg>
<seg id="50">As a result, "Whose Streets?" documents surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, like falling in love and marrying her wife.</seg>
<seg id="51">"I felt like I was naked," said Ferrell, laughing about the first time she saw the finished product.</seg>
<seg id="52">"But I understood that with doing this work and humanizing black folks, there has to be a level of vulnerability."</seg>
<seg id="53">Moreover, Ferrell's story reiterates and re-centers the role of black queer women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="54">Two of the movement's three founders - who coined #BlackLivesMatter on social media in the aftermath of the 2012 killing of black teen Trayvon Martin - identify as queer.</seg>
<seg id="55">"Black queer women in leadership has sustained the movement overall," said Ferrell, "and that's because we're constantly at battle on multiple fronts.</seg>
<seg id="56">Black queer women have to bear the brunt of it all."</seg>
<seg id="57">Folayan agreed noting that "the movement is really upheld by black women and a lot of queer black women."</seg>
<seg id="58">She insists, however, that "this is not some affirmative action type of thing" where Ferrell was chosen as the film's heart because of her identities.</seg>
<seg id="59">"She was the person who was galvanizing this energy," she said.</seg>
<seg id="60">"It's not a coincidence though she was on the front lines, because living life at those intersections as a black queer woman, you have so much on the line.</seg>
<seg id="61">You can feel her energy through the screen."</seg>
<seg id="62">Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, the news cameras are long gone but fraught racial ties between the community and police persist.</seg>
<seg id="63">Ferrell is on probation for 2½ more years for blocking a highway during a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="64">She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls home simply: "A mess."</seg>
<seg id="65">Still, she clings to a chant she's committed to memory since taking to Ferguson's streets a full three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="66">"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="67">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="68">We must love and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="69">We have nothing to lose but our chains."</seg>

<seg id="1">From "dream" to "megalomania": TV readers discuss the Bit Galerie</seg>
<seg id="2">The Bit Galerie is moving people although it is still far from being built.</seg>
<seg id="3">But the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone has been splitting the population into those for and against since its first presentation in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="4">There is barely anyone left indifferent to the matter.</seg>
<seg id="5">The topic is also being discussed on our Facebook page, "Volksfreund Bitburg".</seg>
<seg id="6">Whereas some say of the Bit Galerie, "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or, "That would be really fantastic" (Nicole Schausten), from the other side we hear, "No-one needs that" (Siggi Betzen) or, put quite bluntly: "Megalomania!" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="7">Whilst those in favour count on the gallery drawing more customers into the town, which would benefit the other businesses as well, opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will then be haemorrhaged.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition: The gallery is being planned for exactly the plot where the covered farmers' market is, where 13 direct sellers offer their products.</seg>
<seg id="9">When construction begins, that will be the end of that.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Galerie creators want to integrate a covered market into the new building – and, indeed, towards Beda Platz, with the possibility of sitting outside.</seg>
<seg id="11">Simone Zimmer: "We have been shopping almost weekly in the covered market for years now.</seg>
<seg id="12">Principally our eggs, but also, always with great pleasure, the delicious cakes of our rural women.</seg>
<seg id="13">We have also discovered the butcher's for ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="14">We hope that also while the Galerie is being built, but above all after, there will be the chance to maintain this offering.</seg>
<seg id="15">That's what they have in other cities too.</seg>
<seg id="16">The small covered market in Frankfurt, in particular, is interesting."</seg>
<seg id="17">Gerd Densing: "Whether direct sellers settle in a covered market in the gallery depends on the level of the rent.</seg>
<seg id="18">But that is not exactly likely to be low for the new project."</seg>
<seg id="19">Eva Kilic: "Why a shopping palace in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="20">Whether clothing, shoes, drug stores or supermarkets: I find it unnecessary.</seg>
<seg id="21">There are plenty of those in our city already.</seg>
<seg id="22">One sees, though, how many shop premises stand empty here – some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, since there is not even a regular weekly market here, it is all the more important that we at least get to keep the covered market.</seg>
<seg id="24">For after all, the goods on offer there are fresh, are largely offered directly by the producer, and are good value to boot.</seg>
<seg id="25">As you see, shop premises in shopping centres are only rented by big companies, because the rents there are often not tenable for retail traders.</seg>
<seg id="26">Shame – there are hardly any specialist shops left any more and those that are still around will then probably also disappear."</seg>
<seg id="27">Wolf Fandel: "A shopping centre with a covered market doesn't match up for me.</seg>
<seg id="28">And the Galerie doesn't suit Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="29">In particular: Where should the covered market go while construction is ongoing?</seg>
<seg id="30">The old Edeka would be the solution – even in the long term, if the Bit Galerie does actually arrive eventually.</seg>
<seg id="31">Or is the spectre of the Bit Galerie managing even ahead of time to drive all businesses out of Bitburg?"</seg>
<seg id="32">George Marquet: "It simply will not work.</seg>
<seg id="33">And a shopping centre that stands empty – no-one needs that either.</seg>
<seg id="34">In my opinion, it would be better to support a proper farmers' market, instead of this Galerie.</seg>
<seg id="35">But there is no space left for a covered market thanks to the crazily large number – as I see it – of pointless construction projects in Bitburg</seg>
<seg id="36">If the covered market is destroyed, then another piece of culture will disappear."</seg>

<seg id="1">A Becoming Resemblance: artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA</seg>
<seg id="2">In the center of the room at New York's Fridman Gallery are multiple faces - white, black and brown, each bearing an almost imperceptible resemblance to one another - suspended on wires from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheek swabs and hair clippings sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="4">Manning sent the clippings from the Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst was serving a 35-year sentence after famously leaking classified diplomatic cables through the website WikiLeaks.</seg>
<seg id="5">The new exhibition, which opened on 2 August, is titled A Becoming Resemblance.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combines her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a trans woman and pioneering dissident whose sentence was commuted by Barack Obama when he had just three days left in office.</seg>
<seg id="7">By algorithmically analyzing DNA extracted from Manning and using it to create 30 portraits of what someone with that genomic data might look like, Dewey-Hagborg has created a trenchant, if somewhat cerebral, commentary on not only the malleability of DNA data - the many ways it can be interpreted, and the inherent determinism of those interpretations - but also identity.</seg>
<seg id="8">Manning, who was born Bradley Edward but has spoken openly about identifying as a woman as early as adolescence, was convicted in 2013 on 20 charges, including six Espionage Act violations, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="9">From prison, her image was repressed, so much so that there was just one photo - a granular, black-and-white selfie in which Manning, visibly uneasy, sits in a driver's seat wearing a platinum blonde wig - with which she became associated.</seg>
<seg id="10">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was coming off the massive success of her 2012 project, Stranger Visions.</seg>
<seg id="11">In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts like cigarette butts and chewing gum, extracting DNA from the detritus to conjure an image of what these folks might look like.</seg>
<seg id="12">That was when she received an email from Paper Magazine.</seg>
<seg id="13">"They were conducting an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison and they wanted some kind of portrait to accompany that article," Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press preview of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="14">And she couldn't be visited and she couldn't be photographed at that time, so they reached out to Chelsea and asked if she'd be interested in having a DNA portrait made.</seg>
<seg id="15">The artist and her incarcerated muse became unlikely pen pals, exchanging several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="16">They even created a comic book, Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, that envisioned a future where the president would commute Chelsea's sentence and she'd be able to see the exhibition in person.</seg>
<seg id="17">That Obama would indeed call for Manning's release just days after the book went public was a welcome sort of serendipity after seven brutal years at a military prison in Kansas.</seg>
<seg id="18">There's also something profound and powerful about the exhibition opening now, as Donald Trump wages war on government leakers and transgender troops while finding new, tweetable ways to further inflame the stark divisions he's been called on to mend.</seg>
<seg id="19">When asked about the peculiar timing of it all, Dewey-Hagborg said that "things happen for a reason."</seg>
<seg id="20">In an artist statement written on the gallery's wall, Manning's super-sized signature below it (the "i" in her last name dotted with a heart), called for an end to the "automatic factionalism that gender, race, sexuality, and culture have been the basis of."</seg>
<seg id="21">On the opposite wall is her mitochondrial DNA sequence - a centipede of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="22">By including the 200 letters (or nucleotides, per the artist's sophisticated scientific lexicon), Dewey-Hagborg hoped to illustrate how astoundingly similar, at least in biological makeup, we all are.</seg>
<seg id="23">"What I'm hoping that people will take away from this is that our genome doesn't care about who we are, and how open genetic data is to interpretation, how subjective it is," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories, is also on display.</seg>
<seg id="24">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so this is 30 of those stories."</seg>
<seg id="25">The final piece in the exhibition, which is contained in a single room, is one page from the aforementioned graphic novella.</seg>
<seg id="26">It shows Manning, emerging, King Kong-esque, from the United States Disiplinary Barracks with a speakerphone in hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">"When they chill your speech, then they've won," it reads.</seg>
<seg id="28">"So never shut up."</seg>
<seg id="29">"It came directly from a letter that she wrote to me," the artist, who hails from Philadelphia, said.</seg>
<seg id="30">"I get goosebumps still talking about it."</seg>
<seg id="31">Manning hasn't seen the exhibition in-person yet - as was so presciently imagined in the comic book - but when she does, she'll be greeted in the center of the room by the masks, her own genomic simulacra congregated like hordes of protesters.</seg>
<seg id="32">That was purposeful, too, as is everything in the exhibition, down to the height (5"2, Manning's stature) at which her genetic haplogroups were written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="33">"In the past, I've had them on the wall but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.</seg>
<seg id="34">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that was forming with Chelsea, like the movement that was behind freeing her as well."</seg>

<seg id="1">Northwestern Professor and Oxford University Employee Wanted for Homicide</seg>
<seg id="2">A nationwide manhunt is underway for a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee who are wanted as suspects after a man was found fatally stabbed inside a luxury Chicago apartment, police said.</seg>
<seg id="3">On Monday, first-degree murder warrants without bail were issued for Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, Cook County court records show.</seg>
<seg id="4">The documents say Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed multiple times.</seg>
<seg id="5">A community alert released by the Chicago Police Department says the body was discovered on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="6">Officers received a call and arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several lacerations on his body.</seg>
<seg id="7">Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead on the scene and detectives are investigating the stabbing as a homicide while police actively search for the two suspects, officials said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="9">Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president for university relations, said in an emailed statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been banned from entering Northwestern University campuses.</seg>
<seg id="10">"This is now a criminal matter under investigation by the appropriate authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating in that investigation," Cubbage said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Warren is a senior treasury assistant at Oxford University.</seg>
<seg id="12">A spokesperson for the university and Somerville College said in an emailed statement that, "We have been in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the US investigating authorities in any way they need."</seg>
<seg id="13">The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to turn himself in.</seg>
<seg id="14">Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department Anthony Guglielmi said he strongly encourages the suspects to surrender to authorities.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Police have an idea of their whereabouts but our efforts to locate that are intensifying," Guglielmi said.</seg>
<seg id="16">Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping find the suspects.</seg>
<seg id="17">Guglielmi said police received a call from the Grand Plaza building manager who had just received a cryptic tip that said something had occurred in apartment 1008.</seg>
<seg id="18">Police described the scene as very gruesome.</seg>
<seg id="19">Guglielmi said it is unclear if the incident also occurred on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="20">Lathem and Warren were confirmed to be at the building by security cameras, he said.</seg>
<seg id="21">"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.</seg>
<seg id="22">The management team at Grand Plaza released a statement to residents saying, "Police are currently working on the timeline and background of the victim and are exploring a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."</seg>

<seg id="1">"We'll complete WADA roadmap in near future" - Russian Deputy PM Mutko</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko has said it will not take long to implement the remaining World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria for the reinstatement of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).</seg>
<seg id="3">"A certain stage of fulfilling the road map criteria has been carried out, RUSADA obtained the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).</seg>
<seg id="4">The WADA roadmap was updated in this regard," Mutko stated on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="5">The PM was commenting on the second part of WADA's Roadmap to Code Compliance, which describes the criteria for the reinstatement of RUSADA and which recently published on the organization's website.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Everything has been announced, everything will be implemented.</seg>
<seg id="8">And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee [IOC] and WADA in the near future," he added.</seg>
<seg id="9">One of the criteria mentioned in the list, however, states that Russian anti-doping authorities must publically accept the reported outcomes of the WADA-sanctioned investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.</seg>
<seg id="10">Referring to the matter, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation, as our anti-doping system admitted a failure.</seg>
<seg id="11">All measures have been implemented.</seg>
<seg id="12">But there were no state programs, and we will not admit something that didn't exist."</seg>
<seg id="13">Mutko's words echoed those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of Russia's Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.</seg>
<seg id="14">Talking to Russian outlet RSport earlier in the day, Smirnov admitted past problems in Russian anti-doping bodies, but added: "We have said on numerous occasions, that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="15">No one plans to accept this report unconditionally," Smirnov added.</seg>
<seg id="16">RUSADA was suspended from carrying out doping controls within Russia by WADA in November 2015 in the wake of the doping scandal.</seg>
<seg id="17">It was, however, permitted to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) this June.</seg>
<seg id="18">Following a visit to the organization's headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA is "moving in the right direction" to be reinstated.</seg>

<seg id="1">The start-ups that will help your company avoid becoming the next Uber</seg>
<seg id="2">Amy Errett wanted to gauge employee happiness at her e-commerce start-up, but surveys weren't working.</seg>
<seg id="3">Responses were often vague, unhelpful or, worse, deceitful.</seg>
<seg id="4">And even if she promised anonymity, some workers didn't trust the process.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It just never had consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed.</seg>
<seg id="6">So she called in outsiders for help.</seg>
<seg id="7">A new breed of human resources start-ups is cropping up to help companies figure out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="8">By building and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, they allow companies to do snap polls, target specific teams and demographic groups, offer employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistle-blowers to bypass C-suite executives and go straight to the board of directors.</seg>
<seg id="9">"You've now got tools such as Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where's the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.</seg>
<seg id="10">Errett said she gained more insight into what her employees were thinking and feeling in three years using Glint.</seg>
<seg id="11">In addition to the snap surveys and polls of specific teams, it offers a heat map of the company showing at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low approval scores - allowing her to drill down on why.</seg>
<seg id="12">Companies are coming to realize they must stay on top of their workplace culture, lest they become the next Uber, which has been enmeshed in scandal since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment where those who spoke out were punished.</seg>
<seg id="13">For start-ups such as Glint, this desire for oversight is a lucrative business opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="14">The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to finance tech insights website Let's Talk Payments.</seg>
<seg id="15">Denver, Colo., start-up Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an uptick in interest and activity earlier this year amid Uber's fall into disrepute.</seg>
<seg id="16">Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft, and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="17">Uber recently signed up as a client.</seg>
<seg id="18">Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send customized "pulse" surveys, gather confidential responses in real time, and view heat maps of its problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="19">It also offers an anonymous texting hotline that lets employees report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="20">And if the chief executive is implicated, complaints go straight to the board of directors.</seg>
<seg id="21">"The court of public opinion has usurped regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and chief executive of Convercent.</seg>
<seg id="22">If a company is found to treat its employees poorly or behave unethically, even if regulators don't step in, it can face costly consequences from consumer boycotts, employee attrition and lawsuits, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="23">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees across 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of policies and procedures and offer an easy way to reach its corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="24">Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for corporate headquarters, lodge a formal complaint, and hope it was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was often an intimidating and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday's general counsel, who said there was no good way of tracking employee complaints.</seg>
<seg id="26">Now that the company is using Convercent, though, problems that were previously hidden from executives who sat in offices cities or states away - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage practices - can be more quickly identified and addressed.</seg>
<seg id="27">"I can get closer to that holistic, 360-degree view into the employment experience," said Vitrano, who oversees Ruby Tuesday's risk management group.</seg>
<seg id="28">"And we're protecting our shareholders from employment litigation."</seg>
<seg id="29">Companies started taking ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations from the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="30">But it wasn't until "social media came into its own" that companies realized they couldn't stop their dirty laundry from going viral online.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Prior to using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.</seg>
<seg id="32">Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, charging companies recurring fees to use their products.</seg>
<seg id="33">It's a business model and opportunity that has the approval of venture capital investors, who have propped up both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="34">Convercent raised $10 million in funding in February from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing its total capital raised to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glint secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing its total funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="36">These investments hardly come as a surprise, given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="37">There's a growing body of research showing today's employees expect more from their workplaces than before.</seg>
<seg id="38">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are merely table stakes.</seg>
<seg id="39">Employees want to feel that they're accepted and valued and that they're giving their time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="40">"When people are happy to be at a company, feel their voices are heard, and that the work they are doing is rewarding, they are more committed to making that company successful," said Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.</seg>
<seg id="41">Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies do well; companies do well when employees are committed and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="42">If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee commitment and engagement, it's no wonder they're finding backing.</seg>
<seg id="43">Having data on employee engagement is important, according to workplace culture experts.</seg>
<seg id="44">But the data are useless unless a company's custodians take action.</seg>
<seg id="45">In fact, if a company asks employees for their feedback, it can set an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="46">And if change doesn't come fast enough, or at all, it can breed disappointment and make employees disengaged.</seg>
<seg id="47">"If you're going to ask for 4,000 suggestions, you need to be prepared to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, president of consulting at business management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies make the mistake of relying too much on data collection.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Because if you don't follow through, employees will wonder, 'Did you really hear me?</seg>
<seg id="49">Do you care?</seg>
<seg id="50">And if you don't care, why should I care?' "</seg>
<seg id="51">Madison Reed, which now does monthly employee surveys, has been able to take action the same day a problem is reported on Glint, according to Errett.</seg>
<seg id="52">And, after gathering feedback from employees frustrated by the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add communication training to address the issues.</seg>
<seg id="53">Over at Ruby Tuesday, the company is getting new insight on its employees, and it's hoping that in the long run, this will convert to better retention of workers in an industry known for high turnover.</seg>
<seg id="54">"If you're not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you're going to lose people," Vitrano said.</seg>
<seg id="55">"And if you lose people, you're going to lose customers.</seg>
<seg id="56">And when you lose customers, you're going to lose companies."</seg>

<seg id="1">The NCAA's elimination of two-a-day practices makes for a long day for the Bruins</seg>
<seg id="2">It's pushing 11 p.m. as a throng of UCLA football players linger to chat on one side of the team's new on-campus practice fields.</seg>
<seg id="3">Some have peeled off their jersey tops, revealing backs slick with sweat from the toil of the first day of training camp.</seg>
<seg id="4">For a good chunk of the team, these idle minutes constitute a midday break.</seg>
<seg id="5">Players enrolled in summer classes will head back to their dorms after the three-hour practice to study for final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for meetings at 6:30 the following morning.</seg>
<seg id="6">"This is a grind for these guys the next three days," Bruins coach Jim Mora said not long before Monday turned into Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="7">The NCAA's elimination of two-a-day practices, designed to lighten the load on players, has actually lengthened their days - at least until finals end Friday.</seg>
<seg id="8">That's why UCLA's first three practices were scheduled to begin at 7:15 p.m. to accommodate players' already crammed schedules.</seg>
<seg id="9">The trade-off from no two-a-days is more one-a-days, the Bruins pushing up the start of camp nearly a week from last season and holding practices during summer school for the first time during Mora's six seasons in Westwood.</seg>
<seg id="10">They are scheduled to hold 18 practices through Aug. 20 before beginning formal game preparations for their opener against Texas A&M on Sept.</seg>
<seg id="11">Mora said he supported the NCAA's rule change even if it did add another item to players' busy itineraries.</seg>
<seg id="12">"We're putting this enormous load on them for three or four days and it's very challenging," Mora said.</seg>
<seg id="13">"And they've just pushed through it; they grind, they're great kids.</seg>
<seg id="14">I think once we get to Saturday and we'll have more time, it will really be great."</seg>
<seg id="15">UCLA will close its practices once camp is finished, no easy task given the clear sight lines of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjoining Luskin Center, an upscale hotel that has already been pelted with footballs that cleared a protective net behind a goalpost.</seg>
<seg id="16">Bruins players are scheduled to occupy the hotel beginning this weekend, but Mora acknowledged that there could be an issue once those rooms are vacant during the season.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We will have security," Mora said.</seg>
<seg id="18">"That is a real concern and it's not far-fetched to think that people can rent a room and sit up there and videotape a practice.</seg>
<seg id="19">If you have videotape of a practice, it's a pretty good deal.</seg>
<seg id="20">But we'll have security there and we'll have security up in Parking Lot 8.</seg>
<seg id="21">We'll do the best we can with what we got.</seg>
<seg id="22">I'm not going to worry too much about it.</seg>
<seg id="23">We have a plan in place."</seg>

<seg id="2">Facebook is to send more potential hoax articles to third-party fact checkers and show their findings below the original post, the world's largest online social network said on Thursday as it tries to fight so-called fake news.</seg>
<seg id="3">The company said in a statement on its website it will start using updated machine learning to detect possible hoaxes and send them to fact checkers, potentially showing fact-checking results under the original article.</seg>
<seg id="4">Facebook has been criticized as being one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, which many think influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election.</seg>
<seg id="5">The issue has also become a big political topic in Europe, with French voters deluged with false stories ahead of the presidential election in May and Germany backing a plan to fine social media networks if they fail to remove hateful postings promptly, ahead of elections there in September.</seg>
<seg id="6">On Thursday Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new fact-checking feature was being launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="7">"In addition to seeing which stories are disputed by third-party fact checkers, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, Facebook news feed product manager, in a blog.</seg>
<seg id="8">She added that Facebook would keep testing its "related article" feature and work on other changes to its news feed to cut down on false news.</seg>

<seg id="1">Building a graphic novel: A Castle in England's story</seg>
<seg id="2">In its recent past, the diminutive Scotney Castle has featured in a Squeeze music video and been a bolthole for Margaret Thatcher during the 1970s and 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="3">But Scotney has witnessed 700 years of tumultuous history from its cosy seat in Bewl River valley in Kent, now inspiration for a graphic novel written by Jamie Rhodes, a mop-haired Yorkshireman with a penchant for historical documents.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I find it so beautiful to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says wistfully.</seg>
<seg id="5">"What a personal connection, to hold that letter in my hand."</seg>
<seg id="6">Spanning the middle ages to the Edwardian era, A Castle in England documents the families that lived in Scotney, with each story illustrated by a different, upcoming UK artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is not Rhodes's first book based on an archive: he also wrote 2014's Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional.</seg>
<seg id="8">"I welled up at just the thumbprint on the side of a letter, written by a double agent in the 1700s who was working for the Jacobites," he says.</seg>
<seg id="9">"That's his thumbprint!</seg>
<seg id="10">And letters always smell like smoke because, back then, you lit a fire for light.</seg>
<seg id="11">To someone 300 years in the future, the smell makes it feel like they're there, too.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ah, I love archives!"</seg>
<seg id="13">For someone so smitten with old papers, getting support from the National Trust and Arts Council England and living in a castle for almost four months ("I overstayed my welcome a little bit, to be honest") seems too good to be true.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, going through the archives and studying the manor's many treasures and curios, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and bottles that had spent centuries in the moat.</seg>
<seg id="15">He wandered the grounds and the ruins of the old castle, talking to rangers, gardeners and sometimes the artists at work on his book's illustrations.</seg>
<seg id="16">Then at night, he'd "drink whiskey and get writing."</seg>
<seg id="17">The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust had only gained full access in 2006 when the final heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>
<seg id="18">When Rhodes arrived a decade later, staff were only starting to tackle the archive, which he describes as "hundreds of years of aristocrats going: 'Oh, stick it in the loft'."</seg>
<seg id="19">Diaries, letters from the days of the English empire, maps outlining who owned what: "You'd think land disputes would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was this one birch tree two families were fighting over.</seg>
<seg id="20">Just let it go, guys!"</seg>
<seg id="21">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a jumping-off point to delve more broadly into English history, including The Labourer, which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the 1381 Peasants' Revolt.</seg>
<seg id="22">"There is a record of a riot happening at the castle in 1380, in this book called the Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex," says Rhodes.</seg>
<seg id="23">"The Peasants' Revolt started in that area and I thought, a riot is a good place to start.</seg>
<seg id="24">Maybe the two are connected?"</seg>
<seg id="25">Other stories are rooted firmly in the history of the castle - such as The Priest, which tells the tale of the Jesuit priest whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.</seg>
<seg id="26">Or The Smuggler, which features 18th-century contrabander Arthur Darrell, who is thought to have staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with rocks (a discovery made years later when his coffin was unearthed).</seg>
<seg id="27">The Darrells are Rhodes's favourite Scotney family: "The gentlemen seemed to be quite roguish, always getting into debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.</seg>
<seg id="28">Different generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of handsome guys, with a knack for wooing heiresses."</seg>
<seg id="29">With his assignment in the castle over, Rhodes is on the hunt for other singular writing experiences.</seg>
<seg id="30">He has completed a two-week stint in the Finnish wilderness for a graphic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of an early 20th-century sanatorium that has since been reclaimed by nature.</seg>
<seg id="31">But Scotney holds a special place for him.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I was sad to leave," he says.</seg>
<seg id="33">"It was like: 'Ah, I've got to go deal with fucking real life now.'"</seg>

<seg id="1">Military reform in Turkey – Erdogan's fear of the army</seg>
<seg id="2">Every year in Ankara at the beginning of August, the highest military council (YAS) advises on retirements and promotions in the officer corps.</seg>
<seg id="3">So too this week.</seg>
<seg id="4">At first glance, a normal procedure.</seg>
<seg id="5">But nothing is routine in the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="6">The meeting was no longer held in the general staff building as previously, but rather in the Prime Minister's official residence.</seg>
<seg id="7">Taking part in the discussions chaired by the head of government were now also the five vice premiers, as well as the ministers for defence, the interior, justice, and foreign affairs.</seg>
<seg id="8">The civilians were thus in the majority in the YAS.</seg>
<seg id="9">The government is tightening the reins on the military.</seg>
<seg id="10">Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the army, the air force and the marines were removed.</seg>
<seg id="11">Since the failed coup, head of state Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.</seg>
<seg id="12">Over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army – mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of exiled preacher Fethullah Gülen, whom Erdogan sees as the mastermind behind the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="13">As of this week in Ankara, trials are being held against 486 people who are said to have been directly involved in the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="14">Already on the day after the coup, Erdogan described the attempt at overthrow as a "gift from God", since it gives him the opportunity to "completely cleanse" the armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="15">But does Erdogan really have control over the army?</seg>
<seg id="16">At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article with the headline "Unease in the military headquarters".</seg>
<seg id="17">There are concerns among the general staff of an increasing "Islamisation" of the army, which manifests itself, among other ways, in the lifting of the headscarf ban for female soldiers, wrote the paper.</seg>
<seg id="18">The big clean-up of the army and the security forces is continuing anyway.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the middle of July, Erdogan fired, by decree, an additional 7395 public servants, among whom were 2303 policeman and 546 soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="20">In doing so, it seems as if Erdogan has tamed the military.</seg>
<seg id="21">Previously, the generals were deemed the true authorities in the country.</seg>
<seg id="22">Three times they staged a coup, invoking their role as guardians of the secular state order.</seg>
<seg id="23">After an election victory in 2002, Erdogan has been pushing back the strength of the military bit by bit, not least by invoking the reform guidelines of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="24">Former officers say that Erdogan is purposefully promoting Islamisation of the armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="25">In the magazine "Vocal Europe", an unnamed officer, who sought asylum abroad after the attempted coup out of fear of persecution, warned that the Turkish army would be "full of extremists and Salafists" in a few years.</seg>
<seg id="26">If that is true, Nato would not be able to be indifferent to such a development.</seg>
<seg id="27">In any case, after the purges, there is doubt in the alliance concerning the Turkish army's readiness for action.</seg>
<seg id="28">The governance structures and operational capabilities are "weakened", say Nato diplomats.</seg>

<seg id="2">In recent months, there have been constant arguments about the future of the Rennsteig shuttle – now it is said to be moving very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="3">There are plans to build on the dilapidated stretch of track, on which the tourist trains travel, before the end of the year still.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to ensure the long-term future of the Rennsteig shuttle, construction works should begin on the line this year already, according to reports from the Ministry of Transport.</seg>
<seg id="5">"In taking the decision to continue to commission and to renovate the Ilmnau-Rennsteig line, the state acknowledges that this is an important connection, above all for tourism," stated Transport Secretary Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.</seg>
<seg id="6">He estimated the costs for the repairs to the line to be around 2.5 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="7">The state is taking on 75 per cent of this amount.</seg>
<seg id="8">The contract, on the basis of which, the shuttle is to be commissioned by the state in the future as well, is currently being finalised, explained Sühl.</seg>
<seg id="9">The ministry and Süd-Thüringen Bahn, as operators, are said to already be in agreement over the technical details.</seg>
<seg id="10">"The timetable, the vehicles used and the quality standards have thus been negotiated," said Sühl.</seg>
<seg id="11">The planned contract between the ministry and the train company is being concluded for a period of eleven years.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Rennsteig shuttle should therefore be commissioned as normal from December 2017.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Rennsteig shuttle is a train connection between the stations of Ilmenau and Rennsteig, beloved above all by tourists.</seg>
<seg id="14">In past months, as part of a pilot operation, there were tests to see whether the line gets used by a large enough number of people for it to continue to be commissioned as normal in the future.</seg>
<seg id="15">The line is very run-down in places.</seg>

<seg id="8">"People snigger about them, but the companies are actually shipping quite a lot and we are going to see them a lot more," Mr Sharkey said at the launch of the new report.</seg>
<seg id="9">Modern sex dolls have evolved out of their blow-up counterparts into robots with a silicon skin that is warm to the touch - with deliberately human-like responses achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="10">The user can also "customise" their robot to suit their persuasions, choosing everything from the robot's eye colour, nipple shape to fingernail type or colour.</seg>
<seg id="11">But it gets even more disturbing, with many of the robots possessing "personalities" that would make a Stepford Wife look progressive.</seg>
<seg id="12">Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicon skin.</seg>
<seg id="13">The RealBotix robot, for example, allows users to customise their robots according to the traits they find appealing, such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots, developed by True Companion, which come with pre-programmed personalities, including "Frigid Farrah" that gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality which is matched as much as possible to your personality," the True Companion website enthuses.</seg>
<seg id="16">So she likes what you like, dislikes what you dislike, etc.</seg>
<seg id="17">She also has moods during the day just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="18">She can be sleepy, conversational or she can 'be in the mood'!"</seg>
<seg id="19">There are many disturbing aspects to the rise of sex robots - not least of which is the replacement of real, human relationships - but the subservient female traits, the rapey connotations of making a move on Frigid (read: resistant) Farrah, are the most concerning.</seg>
<seg id="20">On its website, True Companion likened Roxxxy to a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="21">"If woman (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't men have a Roxxxy?" the website states.</seg>
<seg id="22">However, these sex robots are not a mere fetish or just another sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="23">Their emergence and increasing sophistication points to something darker and deeper within our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality toward a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional add-on.</seg>
<seg id="24">Most men, naturally, are not going to keep sex robots, and while the FRR noted their increasing popularity, they remain, for now, on the outskirts of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="25">But what seeps in from the fringes can be highly instructive as to the tenor of the era we're living in.</seg>
<seg id="26">And many people aren't weird or offensive until the free market gives them the permission to be so.</seg>
<seg id="27">There is little coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots have emerged at a time when women's rights are under threat across the globe, when there is a president in the White House who has bragged about sexually assaulting women.</seg>
<seg id="28">The most chilling aspect of the TV series The Handmaid's Tale isn't the graphic imagery, the noosed bodies and gouged eyes, but just how realistic that vision feels.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but, right now, it doesn't feel like a large one.</seg>
<seg id="30">The aim behind these sex robots is to create as much of a physical likeness to actual women (albeit with porn star proportions) as technologically possible.</seg>
<seg id="31">Their creators want them to feel human to the touch, for them to mimic the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="32">But, pointedly, when it comes to their "personalities" the robots do not represent real women.</seg>
<seg id="33">They cannot break up with their companion, or walk out.</seg>
<seg id="34">They have no agency or back-story, nothing to suggest independence or anything that may disrupt the fantasy of total servitude.</seg>
<seg id="35">They are pleasant slaves, in other words.</seg>
<seg id="36">Or to put it into 2017 parlance: handmaidens.</seg>

<seg id="1">Trump's great feat?</seg>
<seg id="2">Making Mitt Romney seem the epitome of common sense</seg>
<seg id="3">It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarised the US electorate have, on a micro-scale, torn families apart.</seg>
<seg id="4">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, newspapers in the US abounded with advice columns on how to deal with the horror of Trump-voting relatives.</seg>
<seg id="5">We are all supposedly straining to burst our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="6">Less remarked on is the power of Trump to bring families together.</seg>
<seg id="7">I mention this because my cousin, a left-leaning poet who lives in Chicago and who's long been at loggerheads with Republicans in our family, has been visiting me in New York this week.</seg>
<seg id="8">She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="9">With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican sibling she had been bickering with about politics for decades, is suddenly and peculiarly on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="10">Around the dinner table this is surely a good thing; but it strikes me that, in a broader context, it carries significant risks.</seg>
<seg id="11">The left has been invigorated by Trump, but the warping effect of his presidency has the power to push us all rightwards.</seg>
<seg id="12">When we talk about "normalisation" and Trump, we are referring to the scary possibility that his antics may one day cease to appal.</seg>
<seg id="13">There is an even scarier long-range scenario, however, in which what Trump "normalises" are rightwing Republicans who, held up against his standards, suddenly seem the epitome of reasonable.</seg>
<seg id="14">I find myself actively nostalgic these days for Mitt Romney's quaint version of crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) - both of which, compared to Trump, seem very mild offences indeed.</seg>
<seg id="15">When Trump goes, the next Republican candidate will merely have to be sane to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="16">While my cousin was in town, we took our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the biggest of the carousels run by the New York parks department, and the best three bucks you can spend in the city if you don't require caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="17">The horses are thunderously huge, the fibre-glass designs on the central cylinder - all gurning clowns and animals twisting to look over their own shoulders in terror - utterly sinister, and the tinkling music oddly transporting.</seg>
<seg id="18">So many of the cliches of a city disappoint: views from tall buildings get old, skylines grow too familiar to offer much of a thrill, and the reality of the city doesn't live up to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="19">Thirty-five years later and I'm still not entirely over the day I discovered Swiss Cottage is not, in fact, a Swiss cottage - the theme pub, Ye Olde Swiss Cottage, doesn't count - but a large roundabout in north London.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Central Park carousel, however, is still a weirdly magical experience, to the extent that two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in their 40s can go on it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="21">If I could have rated the carousel I would have given it full marks, but thankfully nobody asked.</seg>
<seg id="22">In a department store this week, on the other hand, I was required, before swiping my credit card, to rate my transactional "experience" on a scale of one to five stars.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the coffee shop at the corner of my street it's the same thing, plus the option to match the rating with a 15% tip - this for buying something over the counter.</seg>
<seg id="24">The effect of this is not only to slow down what should be a neutral exchange, but to put pressure on the server to inject personality into a situation where none is required.</seg>
<seg id="25">The poor woman in the department store stood grinning apologetically while, wearily, I gave the experience of handing her my credit card five stars.</seg>

<seg id="1">When farmer Arnold found a curious egg</seg>
<seg id="2">As the last amongst the schools in Blumberg, the fourth graders from Fützen and Epfenhofen were let go for the holidays and sent forth for secondary schools.</seg>
<seg id="3">Three of the graduating students will be going to the Gymnasium secondary school, and four to the Realschule.</seg>
<seg id="4">School headteacher Angelika Sitte greeted parents and public representatives in the Biesental community centre in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening.</seg>
<seg id="5">As a symbol for the school graduation, the 29 students from the fourth grade, under the leadership of Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, chose an eagle that is growing up in the chicken yard, but will be then released into the wild.</seg>
<seg id="6">Added to this, the lively bunch performed a musical with the title "The Eagle in the Chicken Yard."</seg>
<seg id="7">Farmer Arnold found a curious egg and had his chickens hatch it.</seg>
<seg id="8">Instead of a chick, a small eagle emerged.</seg>
<seg id="9">Yet hopes of making a chicken out of it were dashed; the eagle spread its wings out on a high mountain and vanished.</seg>
<seg id="10">Afterwards, grades three and four performed a chicken dance, staged by Yvonne Frank.</seg>
<seg id="11">The hens danced in competition with the young roosters, who were wearing top hats.</seg>
<seg id="12">The eagle stands for integration, said headteacher Angelika Sitte.</seg>
<seg id="13">The young animals may well be different from the other young animals (chicks), but belongs amongst them.</seg>
<seg id="14">Though it will never be like a chicken.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is its destiny to be free.</seg>
<seg id="16">She wished for every fourth grader that he/she would feel accepted in his/her new school.</seg>
<seg id="17">There followed a word of thanks to her colleagues, the former headteacher Michael Müller, who is always filling in when there are teacher shortages, and the parent representatives.</seg>
<seg id="18">The time as chicks is now over, explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher.</seg>
<seg id="19">She releases her students only very reluctantly, after two years of teaching, for it has been a really fantastic time.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the end, she was able to depend on the fourth graders.</seg>
<seg id="21">To close, all the students raised a song, with Summertime and Holiday Time.</seg>
<seg id="22">That brought out a lot of joy from the children.</seg>
<seg id="23">There are already eight first graders registered for the new school year.</seg>

<seg id="1">Software update for diesel vehicles: What those affected now need to know</seg>
<seg id="2">How exactly is the software update taking place?</seg>
<seg id="3">Do diesel drivers have to take part in the initiative?</seg>
<seg id="4">The most important questions and answers at a glance.</seg>
<seg id="5">At the Diesel summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for around 5.3 million cars in total.</seg>
<seg id="6">They are intended to improve exhaust emission properties for cars classed under Euro emissions standard 5, and, some under Euro 6.</seg>
<seg id="7">Euro 4 diesel or worse are excluded.</seg>
<seg id="8">Anja Smetanin from ACE Auto Club Europa gives her assessment:</seg>
<seg id="9">Is the new initiative compulsory?</seg>
<seg id="10">No, the brokered software updates are voluntary.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The compulsory updates prior to this apply only to vehicles that have emissions test scamming software," says Anja Smetanin.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA) has ordered that they be retrofitted.</seg>
<seg id="13">How and from when are customers being notified of updates?</seg>
<seg id="14">The manufacturers have announced that there will be swift implementation in the coming months, but have not specified any precise deadline yet.</seg>
<seg id="15">Daimler has advised those affected to write to them.</seg>
<seg id="16">If an inspection is due anyway, this will be settled during the course of that.</seg>
<seg id="17">How long are the retrofittings likely to drag on for altogether?</seg>
<seg id="18">"Difficult to say," says Smetatnin.</seg>
<seg id="19">It depends on the commitment of the manufacturers and political pressure.</seg>
<seg id="20">"For we have seen that thus far, car manufacturers have not been acting of their own accord when it comes to matters of the environment."</seg>
<seg id="21">How long should the update last?</seg>
<seg id="22">The retrofitting itself could last only three to four hours in the garage.</seg>
<seg id="23">It could be more laborious getting an appointment.</seg>
<seg id="24">What do car drivers do who don't drive a car by BMW, Daimler, Opel or the VW Group?</seg>
<seg id="25">The ACE advises waiting.</seg>
<seg id="26">Foreign manufacturers would apparently follow suit, said Smetanin.</seg>
<seg id="27">Is there now the threat of a massive price collapse in Euro 4 cars?</seg>
<seg id="28">The ACE fears that.</seg>
<seg id="29">But just in those regions where there are threats of driving bans.</seg>
<seg id="30">In rural areas, there have as yet been no drops in value for older diesel cars.</seg>
<seg id="31">The ACE advises still waiting before selling.</seg>

<seg id="5">LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the coveted awards of the renowned Kennedy Center.</seg>
<seg id="6">As the cultural establishment announced on Thursday, singers Gloria Estefan (59) and Lionel Richie (68), as well as choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and the TV producer Norman Lear (95) are also among those being honoured.</seg>
<seg id="7">The awards are handed over at the beginning of December.</seg>
<seg id="8">As is tradition, US President Donald Trump will host a reception and will take part in the presentation of awards, together with his wife Melania.</seg>
<seg id="9">For this reason, the award-winner Lear, made famous by a series of TV shows, already announced that he would not be attending the gala.</seg>

<seg id="1">We're making the city liveable</seg>
<seg id="2">Roland Wacker, municipal architect in Haslach, is going into retirement next year.</seg>
<seg id="3">The post has already been advertised – suitable applicants, though, are few and far between.</seg>
<seg id="4">Wacker has been municipal architect for 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="5">And he still finds the work a lot of fun, as he conveys in the press meeting.</seg>
<seg id="6">He reports of varied, but also demanding, tasks that await his successors.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the same time, it surprises him that up until now no application has satisfied the job profile.</seg>
<seg id="8">The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="9">This should then allow enough time for induction training – observing usual notice periods.</seg>
<seg id="10">As Haslach serves as the lower board of building regulations for the joint association of administrations, applicants have to hold appropriate qualifications.</seg>
<seg id="11">For the town wants to maintain this role at all costs.</seg>
<seg id="12">If it could no longer fulfil it, citizens would have to travel to Offenburg for advice.</seg>
<seg id="13">But accessibility for citizens is important to the town and to him too, says Wacker, who reports of a good working atmosphere and a cheerful mood between authorities and citizens.</seg>
<seg id="14">In more than 30 years in office, Wacker has amassed several significant projects that he looks back on with pride.</seg>
<seg id="15">"We're making the city liveable," is something he is certain of, re: the building authorities and his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="16">But in the future too, there are diverse projects on the agenda: the redesign of a former Hukla plot and of the Niederhofen carpark, for example, have been initiated.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Kinzig bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renovated, and refurbishment of the stadium is still a topic.</seg>
<seg id="18">The latter alone will cost as much as 1.5 million euros "if we do it properly", estimates Wacker.</seg>
<seg id="19">"All in all, there are great tasks awaiting my successor.</seg>
<seg id="20">The work here is fun."</seg>
<seg id="21">There is a lot of scope for creativity for a municipal architect.</seg>
<seg id="22">With Haslach's own building yard and garden nursery, there is a lot that can be responded too with a high level of flexibility.</seg>
<seg id="23">"One can affect a lot," says Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned with praise by citizens and visitors.</seg>
<seg id="24">Since the old town as a whole has protected building status, it is important "to have an eye for what fits in" if new buildings are approved, stresses the outgoing municipal architect.</seg>
<seg id="25">In any case, the municipal architect bears a lot of responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is master of construction: "In the end, everything here passes by my desk".</seg>
<seg id="27">For support and coordination, he can count on years-old colleagues: Markus Neumaier (building construction) has been there ten years, Manfred Schöner (civil engineering), already 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="28">Wacker also hopes that his successor will stay a long time: "We are looking for someone who really identifies with the post and wants to stay".</seg>
<seg id="29">For continuity is important not only for a good working atmosphere, but also for the future design of the city.</seg>
<seg id="30">Anyone who wishes to take over from Roland Wacker should, according to the city of Haslach, be able to demonstrate completed studies as graduate engineer or a bachelors degree with a specialisation in architecture and should have good specialist knowledge in the fields of building regulations and planning laws.</seg>
<seg id="31">The municipal planning and building control office is in charge of building construction and civil engineering, urban land-use planning, land acquisition affairs, management of municipal property, the municipal depot with building yard and city nursery, and the lower board of building regulations, including preservation of sites of historic interest.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to police, the as-of-yet unknown perpetrator had thrown the blue bicycle onto the cables from the railway track overpass in the area of Leobener Straße (B116).</seg>
<seg id="3">These were so badly damaged in the course of this that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="4">Investigators are proceeding on the assumption that there were two male perpetrators and have been looking for them since last night.</seg>
<seg id="5">A pink scooter and bicyclist were observed near to the scene of the incident by witnesses.</seg>
<seg id="6">"This goes far beyond a roguish prank," said ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch to the APA.</seg>
<seg id="7">The perpetrator or perpetrators put themselves and the rail traffic in great danger.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition to the damage to the locomotive and facilities, as well as the time in delays and the costs for the rail replacement services, the perpetrators could also be faced with railway customers' penalty fees.</seg>
<seg id="9">Altogether, one can expect a "considerable" sum, said the spokesman.</seg>
<seg id="10">The damage was repaired on Friday afternoon and the rail traffic on the southern railway stretch was able to be operated without obstructions.</seg>
<seg id="11">Almost ten passenger trains were cancelled on Friday afternoon, two of them were long-distance trains.</seg>
<seg id="12">Freight trains were not cancelled, although they were delayed.</seg>

<seg id="1">Red meat, dairy, and chocolate could help relieve IBD</seg>
<seg id="2">Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="3">But a new study claims quite the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based protein and dairy treats could help relieve symptoms of sufferers of inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="4">The incurable condition, which affects around 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurring or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme tiredness.</seg>
<seg id="5">While sufferers are usually advised to dodge meat and dairy to soothe their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found protein's essential amino acid tryptophan helps develop immune cells that foster a tolerant gut.</seg>
<seg id="6">Lead investigator Dr Marco Colonna explained immune cells patrol the gut to ensure that harmful microbes hidden in the food don't sneak into the body.</seg>
<seg id="7">Cells that are capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance, protecting the body without damaging sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the balance tilts too far toward inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease can result.</seg>
<seg id="9">In experiments it was found a kind of tolerance-promoting immune cell appears in mice that carry a specific bacterium in their guts.</seg>
<seg id="10">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the cells' appearance.</seg>
<seg id="11">Professor Colonna said: 'We established a link between one bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - that is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="12">The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more of these immune cells they had.'</seg>
<seg id="13">He suggested if the same works in humans, a combination of L. reuteri and a tryptophan-rich diet may foster a more tolerant, less inflammatory gut environment.</seg>
<seg id="14">Postdoctoral researcher Dr Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas studying a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she discovered that one group of study mice had such cells but another group of the same strain but housed separately did not.</seg>
<seg id="15">She suspected the difference had to do with the mice's gut microbiomes - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live within the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="16">The guts of the mice were DNA sequenced and it was found six bacterial species present in the mice with the immune cells but absent from the mice without them.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mice reared in a sterile environment so they lacked a gut microbiome and do not develop this kind of immune cell were given L. reuteri and the immune cells arose.</seg>
<seg id="18">To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers grew L. reuteri in liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="19">The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="20">When the active component was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism known as indole-3-lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="21">When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's feed, the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent but when tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells dropped by half.</seg>
<seg id="22">Dr Cervantes-Barragan explained people have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and most of us shelter L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is not known whether tryptophan byproducts from L. reuteri induce the cells to develop in people as they do in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="24">She said: 'The development of these cells is probably something we want to encourage since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="25">Potentially, high levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri may induce expansion of this population.'</seg>

<seg id="2">Manchester United have signed a "genius" in Nemanja Matic, believes Jose Mourinho, after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.</seg>
<seg id="3">The £40m signing from Chelsea started the 2-1 win in Dublin, United's final preseason game before the Uefa Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and impressed in the holding role as the likes of Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marauded forward at will.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, having been left out of the Blues' preseason tour of Asia, Matic was severely lacking match fitness and only managed 45 minutes, something Mourinho admitted needed to be improved before the start of the Premier League season.</seg>
<seg id="5">"He needs time but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We will help him to be ready sooner rather than later."</seg>
<seg id="7">As well as Matic, fellow new signings Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started the game at the Aviva Stadium as Mourinho started to shape his starting XI for the start of the season.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wanted another three signings but he insisted that the club had already done a "fantastic job" of delivering three of his four priority signings.</seg>
<seg id="9">"To get three out of four I thank the club for that," he added.</seg>

<seg id="1">New low blow for Martin Schulz – Hanover, we have a problem</seg>
<seg id="2">How the wind changes: when Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD leader, Social Democratic Prime Ministers always looked, with a certain alarm, to Berlin before elections.</seg>
<seg id="3">No disturbances from party headquarters, no opposing winds from the state – that was the campaigners' biggest wish.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since Martin Schulz has been leading the party, that has fundamentally changed.</seg>
<seg id="5">Since then, employees from the Willy-Brandt house have been observing the events in the SPD-governed state capitals with growing horror.</seg>
<seg id="6">What Schulz has got from there since the beginning of the year, you couldn't even begin to describe as an opposing wind.</seg>
<seg id="7">Those were low blows.</seg>
<seg id="8">And one after the other at that.</seg>
<seg id="9">After the surprising end to the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the federal CDU sees a general sign of a move away from coalitions of SPD and Greens.</seg>
<seg id="10">"This once again shows that Red-Green simply can't govern reliably," said CDU General Secretary Peter Tauber to Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland (RND).</seg>
<seg id="11">The surprise resignation of a Green representative plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a stark crisis.</seg>
<seg id="12">Five months ahead of the state elections, his red-green coalition thus lost their one-vote majority over the opposition made up of CDU and FDP.</seg>
<seg id="13">The national head of the Greens, Michael Kellner, has called on defecting Green representative in Lower Saxony Elke Twesten to give up her seat.</seg>
<seg id="14">The cross-over to the CDU represents a clear distortion of the voters' will.</seg>
<seg id="15">Elke Twesten must immediately give up her seat", said national head and campaign leader for the Greens to RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).</seg>
<seg id="16">"It just can't be true," sighed an SPD campaigner, when the bad news reached party headquarters on Friday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="17">Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, is left without a governing majority after the cross-over of Green representative Elke Twesten to the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is the present crisis in a long line of big and small disasters in SPD state associations.</seg>
<seg id="19">And no-one knows what is coming next.</seg>
<seg id="20">The misery began with the unexpectedly decisive defeat in the Saarland election in March.</seg>
<seg id="21">A black eye, no more, his comrades contented themselves at the time.</seg>
<seg id="22">After the state elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything was going to be different.</seg>
<seg id="23">And it was too – in fact, everything was significantly worse.</seg>
<seg id="24">The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into a tailspin, and the Düsseldorf washout bowled the party clean over.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their peers then picked themselves up again in the weeks afterwards, with some effort.</seg>
<seg id="26">Then, just as they had regained new faith, came the G-20 summit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="27">And with that came the next low blow.</seg>
<seg id="28">Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD regional leader, lost his halo that weekend because he was sitting in the Elbe Philharmonic hall while his city was burning.</seg>
<seg id="29">And because in the crisis talks afterwards, he pretty much did everything wrong that you can do wrong.</seg>
<seg id="30">Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.</seg>
<seg id="31">And now Stephan Weil too.</seg>
<seg id="32">Thanks to the VW emissions scandal and his role on the supervisory board, the Lower Saxony Prime Minister had already been facing criticism for some time.</seg>
<seg id="33">Lousy poll results added to that.</seg>
<seg id="34">Despite that, or perhaps precisely because of that, Weil has been attempting ever more strongly in the last few weeks to make a mark in the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="35">The former mayor of Hanover's attempts to build up his power in Berlin have not gone unnoticed by peers in Martin Schulz's entourage.</seg>
<seg id="36">They used to let him do as he liked, since they expected Weil to be a stabilising force for the party.</seg>
<seg id="37">Now, just the opposite may happen.</seg>
<seg id="38">In actual fact, Weil is not to blame for the Lower Saxony Greens' party-internal strife.</seg>
<seg id="39">And Schulz is certainly not.</seg>
<seg id="40">For the time being, therefore, their peers are taking pains to keep their ranks closed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Their anger is directed towards the Greens, and above all, at the defecting parliamentarian Twesten.</seg>
<seg id="42">"It is unacceptable and harmful to democracy how Ms Twesten places her own career interests above the interests of all others," says Matthias Miersch, head of the left wing in the SPD parliamentary group, to RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).</seg>
<seg id="43">Ms Twesten was voted into parliament not for her person, as a direct candidate, but on a Lower Saxony Green Party ticket, continued the Lower Saxony member of parliament.</seg>
<seg id="44">The logical conclusion would be for her to give up her seat.</seg>
<seg id="45">Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD parliamentary group, deplored the "undemocratic manoeuvre".</seg>
<seg id="46">"The will of the voters four years ago was clear: the people made Stephan Weil Prime Minister," said Oppermann, who as frontrunner is leading the Lower Saxony SPD into the Bundestag elections, to the RND.</seg>
<seg id="47">"Now the personal career notions of a future CDU representative is distorting the electoral result," continued Oppermann.</seg>
<seg id="48">He called for light to be shed on the circumstances surrounding the matter.</seg>
<seg id="49">I want to know whether there was anything more there, or if additional commitments were made to the Lower Saxony CDU.</seg>

<seg id="1">Grant money for Town Centre III</seg>
<seg id="2">Anyone who wants to renovate their outdated house will soon be able to get support from the state.</seg>
<seg id="3">Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives for STEG urban development provided information about this on Wednesday in Empfingen.</seg>
<seg id="4">At the beginning of the information session, Schindler once more cast a glimpse back to what has been the case so far.</seg>
<seg id="5">Since 1991, there have been regeneration areas in Empfingen.</seg>
<seg id="6">Back then, in regeneration area I, from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden Württemberg still took on two thirds of the grant amount.</seg>
<seg id="7">From 2005 to 2016, in regeneration area II, the subsidy still lay at 60 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="8">For Schindler, the refurbishments up until this point have been a "successful project" – it is ultimately important to support interior development too, and not only develop new construction areas.</seg>
<seg id="9">On 4th April, word was received from Karlsruhe regional council that there will be a regeneration area III.</seg>
<seg id="10">The grant amount is 833,333 euros, of which, 500,000 euros is to come from the federal state, the rest, from the municipality of Emfingen.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does a regeneration area come about?</seg>
<seg id="12">One will investigate, explains Schindler further, where the "truly old" houses are.</seg>
<seg id="13">What also comes into play, however, is whether there is even any interest to renovate in the planned area at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">If necessary, the area boundaries can also then be shifted again.</seg>
<seg id="15">STEG was represented on Wednesday evening by Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel.</seg>
<seg id="16">Keller presented the content of the government and federal state "Soziale Stadt" programme, within whose scope the refurbishments would then be implemented.</seg>
<seg id="17">The core of the programme is the revitalisation of town centres, the improvement of living and working conditions and preservation and expansion of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="18">The measures would be implemented on a property-specific, that is, per-premises, basis.</seg>
<seg id="19">The regeneration area would then ultimately be laid down as statute.</seg>
<seg id="20">The appropriation period for the subsidies has been running from 1st January 2017 and will continue to do so until 30th April 2026.</seg>
<seg id="21">First, however, stocktaking will be carried out until September of this year, as part of which, those with a stake in the regeneration area will receive a survey to fill out.</seg>
<seg id="22">The resolution should preferably follow in November or December, so that refurbishments can be begun next year.</seg>
<seg id="23">Pietzschmann then explained that every community must carry out the aforementioned preliminary studies.</seg>
<seg id="24">It's about assessing the shortcomings in the urban design and deciding what will be renovated and to what extent.</seg>
<seg id="25">A renovation comment will then be recorded in the land registry for each premises.</seg>
<seg id="26">Pietzschmann will come to Empfingen again himself and get an idea of the location, he promised.</seg>
<seg id="27">Gotzel stressed that the participation of those involved is an essential factor for the project's success.</seg>
<seg id="28">That is why there will be surveys, which will be sent to citizens by post in the coming weeks and can be filled out until the end of the summer holidays.</seg>
<seg id="29">The yellow survey is the "building and property survey", which is about, among other things, the structural condition and the intentions for refurbishment.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the grey survey, the "budget and housing survey", information can be provided on the size, breakdown and residents of a living space.</seg>
<seg id="31">The blue "business survey" is only filled out if business premises operate in the building.</seg>
<seg id="32">It should be noted, however, Gotzel pointed out, that a filled-out survey is not at the same time an application for grant money.</seg>
<seg id="33">What is more, new building initiatives are not eligible for funding.</seg>
<seg id="34">Schindler also stressed that funding would be allocated on a "first-come, first-served" basis – the early bird gets the worm.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is not possible to "reserve" grant money for later.</seg>
<seg id="36">To conclude, photos of the "Town Centre II" project were shown, to "sell" the idea of refurbishment to those present.</seg>

<seg id="1">White House Prop Cost Taxpayers Thousands</seg>
<seg id="2">The White House's decision to fly a Marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event highlighting American manufacturing last month cost taxpayers as much as $24,000, according to military records released to TIME.</seg>
<seg id="3">The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the President is aboard, was the centerpiece of the July 17 event at the White House showcasing American construction programs.</seg>
<seg id="4">President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials toured manufacturing products from all 50 states.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Connecticut-made helicopter was displayed alongside a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a forklift from Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="6">The White House Military Office requested the helicopter's presence in a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn for the "unusual" event, according to the records of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter.</seg>
<seg id="7">"I just wanted you to make sure you were aware because it's such an unusual high visibility event," the commander of HMX-1 emailed his superior, the Marine Deputy Commandant for Aviation, the day before the event.</seg>
<seg id="8">The message indicated the helicopter would arrive on the South Lawn at approximately 7 a.m. on July 17 for the 3 p.m. event, and remain until the lawn was cleared between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. that evening.</seg>
<seg id="9">The note adds that should the departure from the White House be delayed, a second aircrew would be needed for the return flight due to duty-hour restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="10">The original flight crew was with the helicopter during the event, while unit security personnel remained with the aircraft while it was the ground.</seg>
<seg id="11">It was not clear from records provided to TIME whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="13">Records indicate that HMX-1 inquired about whether the event might violate the provision.</seg>
<seg id="14">"One question we asked was if it was a violation of the Hatch Act and were informed it was not," the commander wrote.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Sounds like you are locked," the Deputy Commandant replied.</seg>
<seg id="16">The "Made in America" event was designated an official event by the White House, and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.</seg>
<seg id="17">But even official events have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="18">At the event, the President made a push for healthcare reform efforts then underway in the Senate and touted efforts to rein in government regulations.</seg>
<seg id="19">Using the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="20">Presidents are required to use them for travel.</seg>
<seg id="21">But requisitioning their use solely for a photo-op is unusual.</seg>
<seg id="22">Trump drew scrutiny in February when the presidential airplane taxied to the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Fla., and his Twitter account is flush with messages complaining about his predecessor's use of the presidential aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="23">"The White House is thrilled with the 'Made In America' showcase that featured products from all 50 states that are made by American workers with American materials," said White House deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters.</seg>
<seg id="24">HMX-1 crews frequently perform training flights around the Washington area and at the South Lawn to practice depositing the President of the United States at the White House with inches of precision.</seg>
<seg id="25">When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 practice landings at the White House.</seg>
<seg id="26">The flight for the Made in America event counted toward the aircrew's training requirement for the month, an official said.</seg>
<seg id="27">Unit helicopters also flew an additional 11 hours that day for "non-presidential support missions."</seg>
<seg id="28">The White House said taxpayers did not pick up the burden for any of the other props featured at the event.</seg>
<seg id="29">A spokesperson for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in arranging for the helicopter to be displayed on the South Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="30">HMX-1 doesn't maintain budgetary records for presidential flights, and determining the precise cost incurred by the event is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="31">But according to Department of Defense hourly rates for fiscal year 2017, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.</seg>
<seg id="32">Unit records record the aircraft flight time as 30 minutes each way from its home base at Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="33">The White House argues the true cost of operating the helicopter is well below that rate.</seg>
<seg id="34">"To place a cost to taxpayers based on the reimbursement rate estimates is highly misleading," Walters said.</seg>
<seg id="35">"These rate estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other sunk costs that are included in annual appropriations."</seg>
<seg id="36">According to a 2015 RAND study, DoD reimbursement rates do not include the cost of personnel, but do account for fuel, maintenance, and contracting costs.</seg>
<seg id="37">At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the event.</seg>
<seg id="38">"The idea is to showcase this week things that are made in America," Spicer said.</seg>
<seg id="39">"And I know Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to our national security, that there are, I assume, hundreds if not thousands of people whose job depends on that.</seg>
<seg id="40">And I think, like most Americans, we're all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans worked tirelessly to do.</seg>
<seg id="41">So, of course, it's appropriate to highlight that."</seg>
<seg id="42">It wasn't clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter as he toured the South Lawn for the event, but he did step into the driver's seat of a fire truck.</seg>
<seg id="43">Inside the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky representatives, joking with the media about his own fleet of company products.</seg>
<seg id="44">"I know Sikorsky very well," the President said, "I have three of them."</seg>

<seg id="2">The city is once more organising the nursery lunch itself.</seg>
<seg id="3">With designated contact persons for the children and place in the team.</seg>
<seg id="4">The clock is being turned back in the city's nurseries.</seg>
<seg id="5">On the 1st September, the city of Krefeld is once more taking the catering in the city's nurseries (Kitas) into its own hands.</seg>
<seg id="6">For Sonja Pommeranz, deputy head of the youth welfare services department, this is good news: "We were all delighted".</seg>
<seg id="7">The cooking is still done off premises: a caterer takes care of this task and delivers freshly cooked, chilled food.</seg>
<seg id="8">The city operates 46 nurseries in the district of Krefeld; in 44 of these, the children get a warm meal at midday.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the last nursery year, 2800 children sat at the tables in each case, and demand is growing steadily.</seg>
<seg id="10">"By now, it is not only children who are cared for 45 hours a week that eat in the Kita at lunchtime," explains Pommeranz.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The service is also available for the 35-hour care option, when children stay until 2pm."</seg>
<seg id="12">46 part-time staff are on kitchen duty on 1st September: they warm up the delivered meals, supplement them with salad, crudités and fruit, put the meals into individual portions, hand out the food, clear up, wash up and clean the kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="13">"The workers are assigned to a fixed Kita," says Pommeranz.</seg>
<seg id="14">The size – there are two-group and seven-group establishments – dictates the number of hours worked.</seg>
<seg id="15">"The kitchen assistants now firmly belong in the Kita team," says Pommeranz contentedly.</seg>
<seg id="16">"That way they are much more closely involved, and it is easier for the nursery head to put educational concepts in place."</seg>
<seg id="17">Because it's about this too: a healthy diet and cooking lessons.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The children should help prepare the food."</seg>
<seg id="19">Directly linking the kitchen staff to the team makes sense then.</seg>
<seg id="20">For the children too.</seg>
<seg id="21">"They have a known staff member in the Kita, someone who is familiar to them, and not people who are continuously changing."</seg>
<seg id="22">This continuity is important for the children.</seg>
<seg id="23">The cleaning of the nursery rooms – up until now also a task for the kitchen staff – will in future be taken care of by special cleaning personnel.</seg>
<seg id="24">This option – the separation of cleaning and the kitchen service – not only improves the quality of the kitchen's output, but also has the appeal of having turned out to be the most economical option for the city when comparing costs between in-house and outsourcing, said the press office.</seg>
<seg id="25">And that is despite 46 new part-time staff being employed.</seg>
<seg id="26">"But these hours don't have nearly so much impact for around 750 people in the education sector," says Sonja Pommeranz.</seg>

<seg id="2">A union is seeking reassurance from managers at biscuit maker McVitie's over its long-term commitment to production at its factory in Glasgow.</seg>
<seg id="3">GMB Scotland said the company had been silent over the future of investment at the Tollcross site.</seg>
<seg id="4">More than 500 people work at the plant, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits, among other products.</seg>
<seg id="5">McVitie's owner Pladis said it had invested more than £5m at the site in the last few years.</seg>
<seg id="6">It added employees and union representatives "will be the first to know" if there were any changes to its operations.</seg>
<seg id="7">In a letter to the company's site manager, GMB Scotland called on McVitie's to "address concerns that funding is not being brought forward for the modernisation of production lines."</seg>
<seg id="8">GMB senior organiser Drew Duffy, said: "The fact that we cannot get clarity from the general site manager over the business needs and investment plan for the future of Tollcross is deeply concerning our members.</seg>
<seg id="9">Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is highly concentrated in the local community and the greater Glasgow area, a crucial pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="10">So, from the perspective of jobs, pay and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising cost of living and chronic manufacturing decline, the east end of Glasgow desperately needs a thriving manufacturing presence at McVitie's."</seg>
<seg id="11">A spokeswoman for Pladis said: "The site manager at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday and the company will be responding directly as we value ongoing engagement with employees and union representatives.</seg>
<seg id="12">We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago at which a number of issues were discussed openly.</seg>
<seg id="13">We discussed with employees then that like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we review our operations on an ongoing basis - and that applies across our all our businesses and sites - in order to remain competitive.</seg>
<seg id="14">She added: "In recent years, we have invested over £5m in our Tollcross site, notably on production lines and operational improvements.</seg>
<seg id="15">We fully recognise the heritage of Tollcross as a manufacturing site and should there be any changes to our operations at the site, employees and their union representatives will be the first to know."</seg>

<seg id="1">Did PSG warn Barcelona about move for Neymar three years ago?</seg>
<seg id="2">La Liga side may rue their interest in Marco Verratti</seg>
<seg id="3">Paris Saint-Germain will not let up in their pursuit of Neymar after lodging a £189m offer to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona of the world-record raid three years ago?</seg>
<seg id="4">The sensational approach has lit up the summer transfer window, with the Ligue 1 club ready to break the world transfer record by more than double the previous mark, which saw Paul Pogba return to Manchester United last season for £89m.</seg>
<seg id="5">Once completed, the move will see Neymar become the world's most expensive player and also the highest-paid professional sportsman in the world, with PSG offering wages of over £500,000-a-week after tax.</seg>
<seg id="6">Barcelona are known to be furious with the manner of the approach and the way that Neymar has forced his way out, despite a source close to the Catalans' board insisting that the club have always done their best to look after him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="7">But was the football world warned of this prospect three years ago by the PSG president?</seg>
<seg id="8">When Manchester City expressed an interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a stern warning for any club looking to sign one of PSG's best players.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will be in opposition to them, we'll contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.</seg>
<seg id="10">"We respect all clubs.</seg>
<seg id="11">But if they try to sign one of our players, they'll face consequences."</seg>
<seg id="12">Barcelona appear to have crossed this line, with the Spanish club expressing an interesting in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.</seg>
<seg id="13">PSG made it clear that they would not allow the Italy international to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could well be feeling the repercussions of that interest by losing one of their prize assets in Neymar.</seg>

<seg id="1">Interview: "Domspatzen report exonerates Pope brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2">The Regensburger Domspatzen report on cases of abuse exonerates Pope brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="3">That is what author and historian Michael Hesemann says.</seg>
<seg id="4">The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen is still causing debate.</seg>
<seg id="5">After its publication, Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "We are Church," explained to the German press agency that he was expecting an apology from the former Bishop of Regensburg and current Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as the cathedral's Master of Music, Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emeritus Pope Benedikt XVI.</seg>
<seg id="6">It would be of great service to the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger were to express their deep regret over their own failures or their false assessments of events back then.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Vatican paper "Osservatore Romano", on the other hand, criticised the fact that the coverage was measuring violence at the Domspatzen using "double standards".</seg>
<seg id="8">With respect to the assaults in Regensburg, no-one doubts that these were "disgraceful and shameful acts" that must be punished and prevented in future; however, what was striking was the "level of media manipulation," according to the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the Italian National Bioethics Committee.</seg>
<seg id="9">"The habit of denoting the Catholic Church as the source of all evil is now a part of our everyday experience and sets up public opinion for considering that as normal," writes Scaraffia.</seg>
<seg id="10">Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis also said in an interview with Bavarian Radio that "people love to let loose on the Church, and it is an easy target".</seg>
<seg id="11">She also pointed out that in her youth "beatings were a totally normal educational tool for dealing with cheeky children, of which I was one."</seg>
<seg id="12">She thought it unfair to apply current standards to previous decades, because the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="13">In connection with the reports on the cases of abuse, Pope brother Georg Ratzinger cropped up a lot.</seg>
<seg id="14">Absolutely unfair, says author and historian Michael Hesemann, who together with Ratzinger compiled the commemorative volume "My Brother, the Pope" (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="15">"I have to come to the defence of Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, for in his assessment, the result of the final report "has nothing to do with him".</seg>
<seg id="16">What exactly is in the 440-page report that lawyer Ulrich Weber, commissioned by the Diocese of Regensburg, has produced?</seg>
<seg id="17">In total, 547 members of the Regensburger Domspatzen were "highly likely" the victims of assaults between 1945 and the early 1990s, and 67 Domspatzen were sexually abused.</seg>
<seg id="18">The final report said of Georg Ratzinger, who was working in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994, that "in summary, it can be determined that forms of corporal and physical violence were used by the cathedral's Master of Music R. in many cases".</seg>
<seg id="19">When he was highly emotional, in particular, the punishment for the students could be a lot more severe.</seg>
<seg id="20">Despite this, it is apparent that, in contrast to numerous others of the accused, many victims treasured the general humaneness of R. and therefore, in numerous cases, even associate him with positive memories, despite the violence."</seg>
<seg id="21">Hesemann explains in the interview why, in his opinion, the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen exonerates Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="22">For Mr Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of the use of violence against wards at the Regensburger Domspatzen" paints a contradictory picture of the cathedral's Master of Music, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="23">On the one hand, many students stress his "humaneness".</seg>
<seg id="24">On the other hand, he also comes across as a choleric type and perfectionist, who would often turn to violence if one of the Domspatzen didn't give a top musical performance.</seg>
<seg id="25">How do you judge this final report as his biography?</seg>
<seg id="26">Michael Hesemann: If one makes the effort and reads the entire 440-page-long report from start to finish, one actually has to ask what the name of Georg Ratzinger is doing in there at all.</seg>
<seg id="27">Eight pages are devoted to him, all in one go, and he is clearly exculpated from every suspicion of complicity or connivance in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="28">The extreme acts of violence at the pre-school also occurred outside his sphere of activity.</seg>
<seg id="29">At best, one can accuse him of having found out too late or not having taken the first indications seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="30">The Domspatzen secondary school, where he was active, was perceived by practically all of those asked as – to quote – "salvation", "heaven" and a "better world".</seg>
<seg id="31">So, the vast majority of his students gave Georg Ratzinger a quite glowing testimonial, describing him as "warm-hearted", "beloved", "sincere", "competent" and "understanding", as an extremely good-natured teacher who regularly provide the boys with cakes, biscuits and sweets and was "always mobbed by clusters of children".</seg>
<seg id="32">Only a minority complained about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which from time to time also led to outbursts of anger.</seg>
<seg id="33">The fact that during the course of this he not only banged chairs and threw his bunch of keys to the floor, but even handed out slaps around the face and pulled on the hair or ears of all-too-impudent boys is something that he himself already admitted years ago, that he deeply regrets and apologises for.</seg>
<seg id="34">In his defence, however, it must also be said that such methods of education in that questionable period between the 1960s and 1970s were wide-spread amongst parents as well as teachers.</seg>
<seg id="35">Do you remember such castigation methods?</seg>
<seg id="36">I'm thinking of those of us who were born before 1968, of course.</seg>
<seg id="37">I too experienced that, in a secular school, too, a state Gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="38">Compared to what this report is actually about, namely, appalling sexual abuse and acts of extreme violence at preschool, these are of course mere trifles.</seg>
<seg id="39">So one cannot help but ask whether the fact that lots of media are bearing down on him in particular does not have more to do with his fame and his role as the brother of Benedikt XVI.</seg>
<seg id="40">Indeed, lots of people are still slaving away assiduously on the Bavarian Pope who have never understood him.</seg>
<seg id="41">But the truth is: the report exonerates Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="42">In the media, there was a lot reported on the subject of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen in connection with the report.</seg>
<seg id="43">Is Georg Ratzinger also being accused in the final report of some kind of involvement or complicity in respect of sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="44">Michael Hesemann: Quite clearly not.</seg>
<seg id="45">Not a single one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claims to have confided in the cathedral's Master of Music.</seg>
<seg id="46">Not once were the parents brought in the loop.</seg>
<seg id="47">"I never dared talk about it with my father or my mother," said one of those affected, as a representative for the others, "It was always very embarrassing for me".</seg>
<seg id="48">But the real problem when it comes to throwing light on sexual abuse was and is that the majority of victims stay silent out of shame.</seg>
<seg id="49">If they don't even confide in parents and siblings, then they for sure are not going to to a choir leader, who after all had been a professional colleague, as it were, of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="50">How do the Domspatzen schoolboys judge Ratzinger's role in respect of the cases of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="51">Michael Hesemann: One pupil asked put it this way: "Regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case where he of all people (Georg Ratzinger) had had early enough knowledge and could have stopped the perpetrators in question.</seg>
<seg id="52">I also think... it is quite absurd to assume that... boys opened up more emphatically or clearly or even sooner to him, of all people, than to their parents, the heads of their boarding houses, mentors etc.</seg>
<seg id="53">That one would speak with him about sex... – unthinkable."</seg>
<seg id="54">So, the report comes to the quite clear conclusion: "That affected pupils and/or those around them confided in him beforehand could not be confirmed within the scope of the investigation."</seg>
<seg id="55">As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger has therefore been absolved of any complicity.</seg>
<seg id="56">Therefore, he can also not be accused of not having stopped it or reported it.</seg>
<seg id="57">There is therefore also no reason to bring his good name into association with this despicable crime, as unfortunately happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="58">In the media, one read a lot about "extreme acts of violence" at the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="59">The former cathedral Master of Music, Georg Ratzinger, is accused in the report of "turning a blind eye".</seg>
<seg id="60">Does he have to live with this accusation then?</seg>
<seg id="61">Michael Hesemann: That is indeed the big problem, that in the coverage, everything was mixed up and confounded into a huge melange of sexual abuse and acts of extreme violence and somewhere, in the middle of that, was Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="62">But precisely that, in turn, is an abuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="63">That is to say, there is a clean separation there: between the preschool and the secondary school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and acts of violence as well as, shall we say, other accusations.</seg>
<seg id="64">What is more, the report handles cases from the period since 1945, that is, from four decades, as well, when Georg Ratzinger was not choir leader of the Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="65">The whole hideous educational theory of spanking, the cases where boys were downright bullied and maltreated by sadistic teachers, and from which they suffered terribly, all of these took place in the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions must have prevailed.</seg>
<seg id="66">Yet the cathedral's Master of Music Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with these, for he first set eyes on the boys when they were already at the Domspatzen secondary school.</seg>
<seg id="67">There, as the vast majority of witnesses stress, the topic of the "preschool" was taboo.</seg>
<seg id="68">One was only happy to have got away from it and enjoyed the much better treatment and the conditions that were even "paradisiacal" for many.</seg>
<seg id="69">What was different at the Domspatzen secondary school then?</seg>
<seg id="70">Michael Hesemann: Discipline still ruled there, sure, but there was no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="71">And that applies to Georg Ratzinger likewise, in relation to whom the report concludes that "many victims treasured the general humaneness of R. and therefore, in numerous cases, even associate him with positive memories, despite the violence."</seg>
<seg id="72">So, at best, there remains the accusation of having turned a blind eye.</seg>
<seg id="73">Yet despite all the efforts, the report could only define two periods in which he was given reports about the conditions at the preschool.</seg>
<seg id="74">The first time in 1970/71, when he was just beginning to establish himself and did not want to hear about the practices in a school where he did not even work and for which he was not responsible (according to the witness), and then next only in around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="75">Did Georg Ratzinger systematically close his ears to the conditions?</seg>
<seg id="76">Michael Hesemann: No, for already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzen secondary school, which was even reproduced in the report.</seg>
<seg id="77">In that, he pointed this out, "that in the preschool corporal punishment is still practised."</seg>
<seg id="78">Even when facing the risk of negative press releases he recommended urgent intervention.</seg>
<seg id="79">That was naturally at a time when there was legal clarity that corporal punishment had long been banned in Bavaria too.</seg>
<seg id="80">Before that, it was taking place in a legal grey zone, as every one of us well knows.</seg>
<seg id="81">So it was also difficult for him to assess where those affected were perhaps exaggerating or dramatising and where the permissible limits had really been overstepped.</seg>
<seg id="82">But one cannot say that he always turned a blind eye.</seg>
<seg id="83">That is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="84">It was first in 1980 that corporal punishment in schools was officially abolished in Bavaria as well.</seg>
<seg id="85">Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis indeed asserts that it is unfair to apply today's educational standards to that earlier time.</seg>
<seg id="86">What is your opinion on this?</seg>
<seg id="87">Michael Hesemann: We historians talk here about "the pitfall of anachronism", that is, the danger of evaluating the past according to today's moral standards.</seg>
<seg id="88">The Princess is quite right here.</seg>
<seg id="89">But this of course does not apply to sexual abuse, which was despicable at all times, and also not to that which was perpetrated in the preschool in terms of vile acts and violence against innocent children; that of course goes far beyond what was accepted back then.</seg>
<seg id="90">That is all absolutely terrible and I am glad that it is finally being looked into.</seg>
<seg id="91">But at the same time I have to come to the defence of Georg Ratzinger, for all that has nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="92">His means of disciplining and punishing, that is, slapping around the face and pulling the hair and ears, was widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="93">When corporal punishment was then banned, he complied strictly with that too.</seg>
<seg id="94">What image of his time in Regensburg did Georg Ratzinger reflect then in his conversations with you for the book "My Brother, the Pope"?</seg>
<seg id="95">Did the subject of corporal punishment ever come up?</seg>
<seg id="96">Michael Hesemann: Look, the book is about the life of his brother Joseph, that is Pope Benedikt XVI., told from his perspective, so the Domspatzen played only a subsidiary role.</seg>
<seg id="97">Nevertheless, I do not at all conceal that he ran a strict regime there.</seg>
<seg id="98">But this too has to be said: without this perfectionism, without this demand for absolute discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to forge from the Regensburger Domspatzen – up until that point famous rather on a national level – a world-class institution, a cultural ambassador for Europe and its musical tradition, that twice a-piece went on tour to the USA (1983 and 1987) and to Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="99">Not with biscuits and sweets alone does one all at once turn insubordinate boys into great singers, and face every success, regardless of the area, but rather, with continuous discipline, passion and self-conquest.</seg>
<seg id="100">What kind of impression did you get of Georg Ratzinger the man then in those conversations for your book?</seg>
<seg id="101">Michael Hesemann: Through the work on the book and beyond that, I got to know Georg Ratzinger really very well, and my experience of him was always as a wonderful, humorous, totally benevolent, deeply devout and good-hearted man, who one cannot imagine would be capable of even hurting a fly.</seg>
<seg id="102">I regularly hear how many former Domspatzen still today keep in regular contact with him, 23 years after his retirement, visit him, read to him – he is almost blind – and treat him like a member of their family.</seg>
<seg id="103">Those who up until today still do not forgive him for once being too strict with them are therefore in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="104">Most Domspatzen are today grateful to him for enriching their lives and bringing them nearer to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="105">And for always being a good, fatherly teacher – a strict father, sure, that may well be – but also a loving person, to be respected, whom they still look up to today and downright worship.</seg>
<seg id="106">And please, once more, just to be clear: all that he is accused of are methods of education, that back then were order of the day.</seg>
<seg id="107">We can be glad that we have long overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="108">But it is highly unjust to make a media scapegoat out of a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother.</seg>
<seg id="109">The evil intention behind that is all too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="110">For the report that was just published exonerates him.</seg>
<seg id="111">Now one would ask for the decency to finally leave in peace a 93-year-old man who has rendered great service and without whom probably no-one outside Bavaria and perhaps even Germany would know of the Regensburger Domspatzen</seg>
